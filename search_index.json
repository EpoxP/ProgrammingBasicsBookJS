The book uses JavaScript programming language and Visual Studio Code development environment. The covered training material provides basic preparation for a deeper study of programming and prepares readers for the entrance exam in SoftUni.\n\nThis book only gives you the first steps to programming. It covers very basic skills that you must develop for years, to reach a high enough level and start working as a programmer.\n\n\nThe book is also used as an unofficial textbook for school-level programming courses in the high schools, studying professions like \"Programmer\", \"Application Programmer\" and \"System Programmer\", as well as an additional teaching tool in the initial programming courses at the secondary schools, mathematical and professional high schools., and specialty \"informatics and IT\".\nWho is This Book Intended for?\nThis book is suitable for complete beginners in programming, who want to try what programming is and learn the main constructions for writing programming code that is used in software development, regardless of programming languages and technologies used. The book provides a solid basis of practical skills that are used for further study in programming and software development.\nWhy Did We Choose The JavaScript Language?\nFor this book, we chose JavaScript, because it is a modern language for high-level programming and at the same time it is easy to learn and suitable for beginners. As a use JavaScript is widespread, with a well-developed ecosystem, numerous libraries, and technological frameworks, and therefore gives many prospects for development. JavaScript combines the paradigms of procedural, functional, and object-oriented programming in a modern way with easy-to-use syntax. In the book, we'll use the JavaScript language and the Visual Studio Code development environment, which is available for free from Microsoft.\nAs we will explain later, the programming language with which we start is not essential, but we still need to use some programming language, and in this book, we have chosen JavaScript. You can find the principles and concepts explained here illustrated with other programming languages like C#, JavaScript, and Python at https://softuni.org.\nThe Book in Other Programming Languages: Java, C#, C++, Python\nThis book is available in several versions in different programming languages:\n\nProgramming Basics with Java (English)\nProgramming Basics with Python (English)\nProgramming Basics with C# (English)\nProgramming Basics with JavaScript (English)\nProgramming Basics with JavaScript (Bulgarian)\nProgramming Basics with Python (Bulgarian)\nProgramming Basics with C# (Bulgarian)\nProgramming Basics with Java (Bulgarian)\nProgramming Basics with C++ (Bulgarian)\n\nIf you prefer a different language, choose from the list above.\nProgramming is Learned by a Lot of Writing, Not Reading!\nIf anyone thinks they're going to read a book and learn to program without writing a code and solve tasks hard, they're delusional. Programming is learned with practice, with writing code every day and solving hundreds, even thousands of tasks, seriously and with perseverance, for years.\nYou need to solve a lot of problems, to make mistakes, to fix them, search for solutions and information on the Internet, to try, to experiment, to find better solutions, get used to the code, syntax, programming language, development environment, error search and debugging of non-working code, task reasoning, algorithmic thinking, breaking down problems in steps and implementing every step, gaining experience and lifting your skills every day, because learning to write code is just the first step towards the profession of a software engineer. You have a lot to learn!\nWe advise the reader, as a minimum, to try all the examples from the book, to play with them, to change and test them. Even more important than the examples are the exercises because they develop the practical skills of the developer.\nSolve all the tasks in the book, because programming is learned by practice! The tasks after each topic are carefully selected to cover in-depth the covered learning\nmaterial. The purpose of solving all tasks from all the topics covered is to give complete writing skills to a program code at the beginners level (as is the purpose of this book).\n\nSolve all the exercises in the book. Otherwise, you won't learn anything! Programming is learned by writing a lot of code and solving thousands of problems! \n\nAbout the Software University (SoftUni)\nThe Software University (SoftUni) is the largest training center for software engineers in South-Eastern Europe. Tens of thousands of students pass through the university every year. SoftUni was founded in 2014 as a continuation of the hard work of Dr. Svetlin Nakov in training skillful software engineering professionals by a practical, contemporary and high-quality education that combines fundamental knowledge with modern software technologies and a lot of practice.\nSoftUni: High-quality Practical Tech Education\nThe Software University provides quality education, profession, job and diploma for programmers, software engineers and IT professionals. SoftUni builds an extremely successful and strong connection between education and industry by collaborating with hundreds of software companies, provides job and internships of its students, creates quality professionals for the software industry, and directly responds to the needs of employers via the training process. Learn more at https://softuni.org.\nThe SoftUni Interactive Classroom\nSoftUni’s self-paced programs teach software developers worldwide in the innovative Interactive Classroom that combines video lessons, coding sessions, examples, and exercises in a single platform on the Web.\nUsing the SoftUni Interactive Platform, you write, execute and test code directly into the browser and your exercise solutions are automatically evaluated by the integrated Judge system. If you have difficulties with an assignment, you can get assistance in multiple ways: with automated hints and guidelines or through SoftUni’s help center. Try it at https://softuni.org.\nThis is how the SoftUni Interactive Classroom looks like:\n\n\nVideo: SoftUni and SoftUni Judge\nWatch a video lesson about SoftUni and SoftUni Judge here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwLET8SDBE4.\nThe Automated Judge System\nThe SoftUni Judge system (https://judge.softuni.org) is an automated Internet system for checking the solutions of programming exercises via series of tests. The submission and verification happen in real time: you submit the solution and within seconds you get an answer whether it is correct. You earn points for each task depending on your answer. For a completely right one, you get the maximum points for the problem. With a partially correct solution, you receive a fraction of the points. And with a completely wrong answer, you get 0 points. This how the SoftUni Judge looks like:\nAll problems from the current book are available for testing in SoftUni Judge and we strongly recommend testing them after you solve them to be sure you don't miss anything and that your solution works correctly according to the task requirements.\nKeep in mind some specifics about SoftUni Judge:\n\nFor each task the Judge system keeps the best score you had. Therefore, if you upload a solution with wrong code or lower score compared to the previous one, the system won't take away your points.\nThe output of your program is compared by the system to a strictly expected result. Every unnecessary symbol, missing comma or space may lead to 0 points on a particular test. The output that the Judge system expects is described in the requirements of every task and nothing else should be added. \nExample: If the output requires to print a number (ex. 25), do not display any descriptive messages such as The result is: 25, just print as it is required, i.e. only the number.\n\nThe SoftUni Judge system is available any time via its website: https://judge.softuni.org.\n\nUsing the SoftUni system is free and it's not bound with the participation in SoftUni's courses.\n\nWe are convinced that after sending a few tasks you will like getting instant feedback for your solutions and the Judge system will become your favorite assistant in your programming practice.\nHow to Become a Software Developer?\nDear readers, probably many of you have the ambition to become programmers and develop software for a living, or work in the IT area. That's why we have prepared for you a short guide on \"How to become a programmer\", so we can help you take the first steps towards this desired profession.\nYou can become a programmer (working in a software company) after at least 1-2 years of intensive training and coding every day, solving thousands of programming tasks, development of several more serious practical projects and gaining a lot of experience with code writing and software development. You can't become a programmer for a month or two! The profession of software engineer requires a lot of knowledge, covered with a lot of practice.\nVideo: Become a Software Engineer – 4 Essential Skills\nWatch a video lesson about SoftUni and SoftUni Judge here: https://youtu.be/Ds5PD3UW57k.\nThe 4 Essential Skills of the Software Developers\nThere are 4 main skill groups where all programmers must have. Most of these skills are resistant in time and are not influenced by the development in specific technologies (that are changing constantly). These are the skills that any good programmer has and to which every beginner must strive:\n\nCoding (20%)\nAlgorithmic thinking (30%)\nComputer science and software engineering concepts (25%)\nLanguages and software technologies (25%)\n\nSkill #1 – Coding (20%)\nWriting code forms around 20% of the minimum knowledge and skills of a programmer, needed for starting a job in a software company. The skill of coding includes the following components:\n\nWorking with variables, conditional statements, loops\nUsing functions, methods, classes and objects\nData manipulation: arrays, lists, hash tables, strings\n\nThe skill of coding can be acquired in a few months of hard learning and solving practical problems by writing code every day. This book covers only the first point of coding: working with variables, conditional statements and loops. The rest remains to be learned in follow-up trainings, courses and books.\nThe book (and the courses based on it) gives only the beginning of one long and serious training on the way to professional programming. If you don't learn perfectly the material from this book, you can't become a programmer. You are going to miss fundamentals and it will be harder in the future. For this reason, give enough time to programming basics: solve many problems and write code every day for months until you learn to solve every problem from the book very easily. Then go ahead.\nWe specifically note that the programming language does not matter for the ability to code. You can code or not. If you can code with C#, you will easily learn to code with Java, C++ or other languages. That's why the coding skills are being studied quite seriously at the in all SoftUni software engineering programs, and each programming book for beginners starts with them, including this one.\nSkill #2 – Algorithmic Thinking (30%)\nThe algorithmic (logical, engineering, mathematical, abstract) thinking forms around 30% of the minimum skills of a programmer needed to start the profession. Algorithmic thinking is the ability to break a particular problem into a logical sequence (algorithm), to find a solution for every separate step and then assemble the steps into a working solution. That is the most important skill of any programmer.\nHow to build algorithmic thinking?\n\nAlgorithmic thinking is developed by solving multiple  programming (1000+) problems, as diverse as possible. That is the recipe: solving thousands of practical problems, building algorithms and implementing the algorithms, along with debugging the issues that come up in the process. \nSciences like physics, mathematics and similar ones helps a lot, but they are not mandatory! People with engineering and technical skills usually learn very easily to think logically, because they already have problem solving skills, even if it is not algorithmic.\nThe ability of solving programming problems (for which algorithmic thinking is needed) is extremely important for a programmer. Many companies test particularly this skill during their job interviews.\n\nThe current book develops the beginner level of algorithmic thinking, but it's not enough to make you a good programmer. To become good at this profession you must add logical thinking and problem solving skills, beyond the range of this book. For example, working with data structures (arrays, lists, matrices, hash-tables, binary trees) and basic algorithms (searching, sorting, searching in tree structures, recursion, etc.).\nAlgorithmic thinking skill can be developed while studying in the Software Developer programs at SoftUni as well as in specialized algorithmic courses data structures and algorithms.\nAs you may have guessed, the choice of programming language does not matter for the development of algorithmic thinking. It is a skill unrelated to Programming. Because of their well-developed logical thinking, there is the misconception that all programmers are smart people and having a high IQ is a requirement for entering into the profession.\nSkill #3 – Computer Science and Software Engineering Concepts (25%)\nFundamental knowledge and skills for programming, software development, software engineering and computer science comprise around 25% of the developer's minimum skills to start a job. Here are the more important of these skills and knowledge:\n\nBasic mathematical concepts related to programming: coordinate systems, vectors and matrices, discrete and non-discrete mathematical functions, state automata and state machines, combinatorics and statistics concepts, algorithm complexity, mathematical modeling and others\nProgramming skills – code writing, working with data, using conditional statements and loops, working with arrays, lists and associative arrays, strings and text processing, working with streams and files, using programming interfaces (APIs), working with IDE, debugger, developer tools, etc.\nData structures and algorithms – lists, trees, hash-tables, graphs, search, sorting, recursion, binary search trees, etc.\nObject-oriented programming (OOP) – working with classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, abstraction, interfaces, data encapsulation, exceptions management, design pattern\nFunctional programming (FP) – working with lambda functions, higher order functions, functions that return a function as a result, closure, etc.\nDatabases – relational and non-relational databases, database modeling (tables and links between them), SQL query language, object-relational mapping (ORM), transactions and transaction management\nNetwork programming – network protocols, network communication, TCP/IP, concepts, tools and technologies from computer networks\nClient-server interaction, peer to peer communication, back-end technologies, front-end technologies, MVC architectures\nTechnologies for server-side development (back-end) – Web server architecture, HTTP protocol, MVC architecture, REST architecture, web development frameworks, templating engines\nFront-end technologies (client-side development) – HTML, CSS, JS, HTTP, DOM, AJAX, communication with back-end, calling REST API, front-end frameworks, basic design and UX (user experience) concepts\nMobile technologies – mobile apps, Android and iOS development, mobile user interface (UI), calling server logic \nEmbedded systems – microcontrollers, digital and analog input and output control, sensor access, peripheral management\nOperating systems (OS) – working with operating systems (Linux, Windows, etc.), installation, configuration and basic system administration, process management, memory, file system, users, multitasking, virtualization and containers\nParallel and asynchronous programming – thread management, asynchronous tasks, promises, common resources, and access synchronization\nSoftware engineering – source control systems, development management, task planning and management, software development methodologies, software requirements and prototypes, software design, software architectures, software documentation\nSoftware testing – unit testing, test-driven development, QA engineering, error reporting and error tracking, automation testing, build processes and continuous integration\n\nWe need to once again mention that the programming language does not matter for acquiring all these skills. You will accumulate them slowly, over years. Some fundamental knowledge can be learned theoretically, but to get an in-depth understanding of it you need a lot of practice.\nFundamental knowledge and skills for programming, software development, software engineering, and computer science are taught during the Software Developer Program, as well as a number of additional trainings. Working with a variety of software libraries, APIs, frameworks and software technologies and their interaction gradually builds this knowledge and skills, so do not expect that you will understand them from a single course, book or project.\nHaving basic knowledge in the areas listed above is enough to start a job as a programmer. Your further improvement will come as a result of the technology and development tools you will use in your day-to-day work.\nSkill #4 – Programming Languages and Software Technologies (25%)\nProgramming languages and software development technologies form around 25% of a programmer's skills. They have the largest learning content, but they change very fast over time. If we look at the job offers in the software industry, they usually mention words like the ones below, but in the job offers they secretly mention the three main skills: coding, algorithmic thinking and knowing the fundamentals of computer science and software engineering.\nFor those clearly technological skills the programming language does matter.\n\nNote: only for these 25% of the profession the programming language does matter!\nFor the rest 75% of the skills the programming language doesn't matter, and these skills are resistant in time and transferable between different languages and technologies.\n\nHere are some commonly used software development stacks which software companies are looking for (as of Jan 2019):\n\nC# + OOP + FP + classes from .NET + SQL Server databases + Entity Framework (EF) + ASP.NET MVC + HTTP + HTML + CSS + JS + DOM + jQuery + cloud + containers\nJavaScript (JS) + OOP + FP + databases + MongoDB or MySQL + HTTP + web programming + HTML + CSS + JS + DOM + jQuery + Node.js + Express + Angular or React + cloud + containers\nPython + OOP + FP + databases + MongoDB or MySQL + HTTP + web development + HTML + CSS + JS + DOM + jQuery + Django or Flask + cloud + containers\nJava + Java API classes + OOP + FP + databases + MySQL + HTTP + web programming + HTML + CSS + JS + DOM + jQuery + JSP / Servlets + Spring MVC or Java EE / JSF + cloud + containers\nPHP + OOP + databases + MySQL + HTTP + web development + HTML + CSS + JS + DOM + jQuery + Laravel or Symfony or other MVC framework for PHP + cloud + containers\nC++ + OOP + STL + Boost + native development + databases + HTTP + other languages and technologies\nSwift + OOP + MacOS + iOS + Cocoa + Cocoa Touch + XCode + HTTP + REST + other languages and technologies\nGo + OOP + Linux + Protobuf + gRPC + cloud + containers + other languages and technologies\n\nIf the words above look scary and incomprehensible, then you are at the very beginning of your career and you need many years of learning until you reach the profession of a software engineer. Do not worry, every programmer goes through one or several technology stacks and needs to study a set of interconnected technologies, but it is imperative for you is know how to write programming logic (to code) and think algorithmically (to solve programming problems). Becoming a good software engineer is impossible without those skills!\nThe Programming Language Doesn't Matter!\nAs it already became clear, the difference between programming languages and more specifically between the skills of developers in different languages and technologies forms around 10-20% of the skills.\n\nAll programmers have around 80-90% of the same skills that do not depend on the programming language! These are the skills to program and to design and develop software, that are very similar in different programming languages and development technologies.\nThe more languages and technologies you know, the faster you will learn new ones, and the less you will feel the difference between them.\n\nLet us state once again that the choice of programming language (mostly) does not matter - you just need to learn to program. This process starts with coding (by reading this book or enrolling in a Software Developer program, continues with mastering more complex programming concepts (like data structures, algorithms, OOP, and FP), and includes using fundamental knowledge and skills for software development, software engineering, and computer science.\nOnly when you start working with a specific technology into a software project you will need a specific programming language, knowledge about specific programming libraries (APIs), frameworks and software technologies (front-end UI technologies, back-end technologies, ORM technologies, etc.). Keep calm, you will learn them, all programmers are learning them, but first you need to learn the foundation: to program and do it well.\nThis book uses the C# language, but it is not required and can be replaced with Java, JavaScript, Python, PHP, C++, Ruby, Swift, Go, Kotlin, or any other language. To be a software developer, you need to learn coding (20%), learn algorithmic thinking, and solve problems (30%), to have fundamental knowledge of programming and computer science (25%) and to master a specific programming language and the technologies around it (25%). Be patient, for a year or two all this can be mastered on a good starting level, if you are serious.\nThe History Behind This Book\nThe main engine and project manager for the creation of the current free programming book for beginners with open source is Svetlin Nakov, PhD.\nIn the beginning, these chapters had a wider reach and included more theory, but in 2016 Svetlin Nakov, PhD completely revised them, renovated, simplified, and directed them to be more practical. This is how the learning content core of this book was created.\nOn the principle of free software and free knowledge, Svetlin Nakov led a team of volunteers and started this open-source project, initially to create a book based on programming with the C# language and later with other programming languages.\nAuthors Team\nThis book, \"JavaScript Basics\", was developed by a broad author's team of volunteers who took their time to give you this systematic knowledge and guidance at the start of programming.

First Steps in Programming","keywords":"","body":"Chapter 1. First Steps in Programming\nIn this chapter, we are going to find out what programming is at its core. We will get familiar with the idea of programming languages and explore the environments for software development (Integrated Development Environment – IDEs); we'll see how to work with them, in particular with Visual Studio Code. We will write and execute our first program written in the programming language JavaScript and then we'll exercise on a few tasks: we will create a console-based program and a Web application. We will learn how to use SoftUni's Judge System to check the correctness of our solutions to the problems in this book. Finally, we'll look at some typical mistakes made during code writing and we'll learn how to avoid them.\nWhat Does \"To Program\" Mean?\nTo program means to give instructions to the computer, for example, play a certain sound, print something on the screen, or multiply two numbers. When there's a series of commands, we have a computer program (script). The computer program's text is called program code (source code or just code).\nComputer Programs\nComputer programs represent a series of commands written in a particular programming language, like Python, C#, Java, JavaScript, PHP, C, C++, Go, etc. To write commands, we need to be familiar with the syntax and semantics of the language we'll be using, in our case – JavaScript. In this book, we'll cover programming in general, as well as JavaScript's particular syntax and semantics. We'll examine each step of writing code, starting with the simplest and eventually reaching more complex programming constructs.\nAlgorithms\nComputer programs usually execute some sort of algorithm. Algorithms are a series of steps used to complete a task and achieve an expected result - something like a recipe. For example, if we need to fry some eggs, we follow a certain recipe (algorithm): we heat some oil in a pan, then we break the eggs, we wait until they're cooked, and finally, move the pan away from the heat. Similarly, in programming, computer programs execute algorithms – a series of commands needed to complete a certain task. If we want to print a series of numbers in ascending order, for example, we need an algorithm. It will go through all the numbers, find the smallest one and print it, then go through the rest of them and do the same until there are no more numbers left.\nTo make creating programs, writing program code (commands), executing it and other operations that have to do with programming more convenient, we need a development environment (IDE) like Visual Studio Code.\nProgramming Languages, Compilers, Interpreters and Development Environments\nProgramming languages are artificial languages (syntax for expression), designed to issue commands which we expect the computer to read, process, and execute. With the help of programming languages, we write a series of commands (programs) that tell the computer what to do. Execution of computer programs can be achieved by using either a compiler or an interpreter.\nThe compiler translates code from a programming language into machine code and for each construct (command) in the code, it chooses an appropriate, predefined fragment of machine code while simultaneously checking the program's text for errors. Together, all the compiled fragments represent the original program translated in machine code, exactly how the computer's microprocessor is expecting it. After it's been compiled, the program can be directly executed by the microprocessor in cooperation with the operating system. Compiled programming languages compile the program before executing it and find syntactic errors (incorrect commands) during compile time. Languages like C++, C#, Java, Swift, and Go all work with compilers.\nSome programming languages don't use a compiler but are directly interpreted by specialized software called an interpreter. The interpreter is a program that executes programs, written in some programming language. It executes the program's commands in sequence and understands not only single commands and series of commands but also other language constructs (checks, iterations, functions, etc.). PHP, Python, and JavaScript are languages that work with an interpreter and are executed without the need to be compiled. Due to lack of preliminary compilation, interpreted languages' errors are found during run time, after the program has already started working.\nOverall, compiled languages work more slowly than their interpreted counterparts. The difference in execution speed is sometimes insignificant, but in other cases massive. In interpreted programming languages we can change code more quickly and re-execute (to remove a mistake, for example), while compiled languages are slower after a code change has been introduced, due to the need for compilation.\nThe development environment (Integrated Development Environment – IDE) combines traditional instruments for software development. In the development environment we write code, compile and execute programs. Development environments incorporate a text editor for writing code, a programming language, a compiler or interpreter, an execution environment where our program is executed, a debugger that traces our program and looks for errors, instruments for design, and user interface as well as other instruments and add-ons.\nDevelopment environments are convenient because they incorporate everything necessary to develop a program, so there's no need to leave the environment. If we don't use a development environment, we'll have to write code in a text editor, compile it with a command from the console, execute it with another command from the console and write additional commands, when needed, which will cost a lot of time. This is why most programmers use IDEs for everyday work.\nProgramming with JavaScript is usually done in the development environment Visual Studio Code which is developed and freely distributed by Microsoft. You can download it from: https://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/.\nAlternatives to Visual Studio Code are WebStorm (https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/), Atom (https://atom.io/), and others. In this book, we'll be using the development environment Visual Studio Code.\nLow-Level, High-Level Languages and Runtime Environments\nA program is, in essence, a set of instructions that ask the computer to carry out certain tasks. They are entered by the programmer and executed unconditionally by the machine.\nThere are different types of programming languages. Lowest-level languages can be used to write the very instructions commanding the processor - Assembler is one such language. Higher-level languages can be utilized to create an operating system, drivers for managing hardware (video card drivers, for example), web browsers, compilers, engines for game graphics (game engines), and other system components and programs. Even higher-level languages like JavaScript, C#, and Python are used to create application software, like programs for reading mail or chatting.\nLow-level languages command hardware directly and require a lot of effort and a vast number of commands, to carry out a certain task. Higher-level languages require less code to achieve the same result but have no direct access to hardware. They are used to develop application software like web and mobile applications.\nMost of the software we use daily like music players, video players, GPS programs, etc. is written on high-level languages for application programming like Python, JavaScript, C#, Java, C++, PHP, etc.\nJavaScript is an interpreted language which means we write commands and they're executed immediately after running the program. As a result of that, we will realize we've made a mistake in our code only after we've started our program and reached the incorrect command. In cases like these, IDEs like Visual Studio Code are extremely helpful as they check our code while we're writing it and alarm us of potential issues. After we've written our code and want to test it, we can save it in a file with extension .js. \nMost programming languages are specialized in the development of certain types of applications – Desktop for Windows and Mac, mobile apps, server applications, applications that command smart gadgets, and many more. JavaScript is one of the few languages which allow you to create an application in every field you can think of – from websites and mobile apps to desktop applications.\nThe most popular JavaScript interpreters are the web browsers you use every day – Chrome, Firefox, Internet Explorer, etc. When loading your favorite website, it will likely contain JavaScript files which will execute upon opening the site and make your viewing experience of the site much more pleasant and dynamic. It's also very often the case that if the site has dropdown menus, animations, user registration, and annoying adverts, they are realized exactly by using the JavaScript language. \nYou'll often hear that a certain piece of code is run on the client-side, which means that the JavaScript code is executed in your browser, which plays the role of client or receiver. But a receiver would have no purpose to exist without a transmitter. In the world of technology, these transmitters are called servers. You can imagine servers as extremely powerful computers, which many people have access to. Every site uses a similar server as its base – i.e. files that enable the site to look the way you see it – pictures, texts, JavaScript files, are located on a certain server. Your browser (client) connects to the server where the site you're visiting is located, and the server, in turn, sends back the necessary files for your favorite website to visualize in front of your eyes. Your browser is like a car radio where you listen to your favorite program, and the server is the building that transmits that program, although the communication follows a slightly different route in this case. \nThe other popular JavaScript interpreter is NodeJS. You can imagine it's like an application you install on your computer which enables it to understand JavaScript the same way your browser does. That way you can execute JavaScript code directly on your computer, without the need for a browser. As we just mentioned, servers are just more powerful computers. They start understanding JavaScript in the same way your computer does – by having NodeJS installed. You can install NodeJS from their official website https://nodejs.org completely free of charge, by simply following the instructions. \nComputer Programs - Execution\nAs we already mentioned, a program is a series of commands, in other words, it describes a series of calculations, checks, iterations, and numerous other operations, which aim at producing a result.\nThe program is written in text format and the text is called source code. It's saved in a file with extension .js (main.js, for instance), and then it can be executed on your browser or the console with the help of NodeJS. In a moment we'll have a look at both options.\nComputer Programs – Problems\nLet's start with a very basic example of a short JavaScript program that we'll run directly in your web browser (it supports JS without the need to install additional software).\nProblem: a Program, Which Notifies the User\nOur first program will consist of a single JavaScript command, which notifies the user they've won 1 000 000 dollars, as is often the case when you're browsing through a website with a lot of spam and adverts:\nalert(\"Congratulations!!! You have just won $1 000 000!\");\n\nWe can run our program by using our browser's JavaScript console. In Chrome, for example, we can pull that up by pressing [F12] and we can then write our code in the [Console] window.\n\nThe result is something like this: a modal popup message in your browser: \n\nProblem: a Program, Which Spams the User with Notifications\nWe can increase the previous program's complexity by creating numerous command which repeat in sequence and notify the user they've won the lottery:\nfor (i = 0; i \nIn the example above we make the computer display notifications one after another until they become 10. The result is one very irritated user:\n\nWe will learn how iterations (loops) in programming work in the chapter \"Loops\", but for now, let's assume that they just repeat a command many times.\nProblem: Program, Which Converts BGN (Bulgarian Levs) into Euro\nLet's have a look at another simple program that asks the user for an amount of money in levs (Bulgaria's currency)(whole number), makes sure that what's been entered is a number, converts it into euro (by dividing it by the euro exchange rate) and prints the result. This is a program of 3 consecutive commands. \nlet myMoney = prompt(\"How much money do you want to convert:\");\n\nlet leva = parseInt(myMoney);\nlet euro = leva / 1.95583;\nconsole.log(euro);\n\nIf we run this program in the browser's JavaScript console, we'll receive something like this:\n\nWe looked at three examples of computer programs: single command, series of commands in a loop, and a sequence of four commands. Let's now move on to the more exciting bit: writing our programs in JavaScript and executing them outside the browser.\nHow do We Write a Console Program?\nLet's go through the steps for creating and executing a computer program that uses a text console (window for entering and receiving text) to read and write its data. Such programs are known as console-based. Before we do that though, we need to install and set up our development environment, where we'll write and execute the JavaScript programs from this book and the exercises that go along with it.\nDevelopment Environment (IDE)\nAs previously mentioned, we need a development environment (IDE) to program. The IDE is a program editor, where we can write, compile and execute our program code, discover our mistakes, correct them and start the program again.\n\nFor programming in JavaScript, we use the Visual Studio Code environment, suitable Windows, Linux, and macOS operating systems.\nIf we are programming in Java we can use IntelliJ, Eclipse, or NetBeans.\nIf we are programming in Python we can use PyCharm.\n\nInstalling Visual Studio Code\nIn the following paragraphs, we go through the steps for installing Visual Studio Code (version 1.19.1) in great detail. After we download and start the installation file, the following screen should appear:\n\nPress the [Next] button and then agree to the terms and conditions:\n\nVisual Studio Code starts installing and once it's finished, we're almost ready to start writing code.\nAfter you start VS Code, a window similar to the one below should appear:\n\nNow is the time to make our development environment as pleasant as possible. Visual Studio Code is famous for being the IDE with the most options for personalization. Usually, this personalization comes in the form of add-ons (extensions). A list of all add-ons can be found on the official website: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/. Just keep in mind that most of these extensions are specific to a particular programming language. \nFor a start, we recommend installing a couple of extensions that will drastically improve your JavaScript code writing:\n\nBeautify - https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=HookyQR.beautify – this is an extension that helps you order your code and keep it looking clean.\nJSHint - https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.jshint – as we mentioned, JavaScript is an interpreted language and core errors would appear only after running the program. This extension scans and alarms for potential issues while the code is written and before running the program.\n\nThey can be installed either via the given links or by going through the following steps in Visual Studio Code:\n\nIn the leftmost panel, open the lowest tab – Extensions.\nIn the search field enter the name of the extension you'd like to install.\nChoose the most appropriate option from the results.\nThen press the [Install] button.\nAnd restart Visual Studio Code.\n\n\nThat's it. We're ready to start working with Visual Studio Code and JavaScript.\nOnline Development Environments\nThere are also alternative environments to develop online, directly in your web browser. They aren't very easy to use but if you have no other option, you can start your education with them and install Visual Studio Code later. Such a site for online JavaScript development is JSBin - https://jsbin.com/?js,console.\n\nAlternatively, we can do quick tests directly in our browser by pressing F12 but in general, this is an option that works for very few lines of\ncode. Here's an example:\n\nProblem: Creating a Console Application 'Hello JavaScript'\nLet's go back to our console program. We already have Visual Studio Code and we can start it. Then create a new JavaScript file: [File] → [New File]:\n\nIt's crucial to save our file from [File] → [Save], and don't forget the .js extension! We also need to give it a meaningful name like helloJS:\n\nWriting Program Code\nWriting code in JavaScript requires no additional preparation – creating a file with the .js extension is all we need. So let's directly proceed with writing our first line of code. We'll write the following command:\nconsole.log(\"Hello JavaScript!\");\n\nHere's what our program should look like in Visual Studio Code:\n\nThe console.log('Hello JavaScript!') command means printing (log(…)) on the console (console) the message Hello JavaScript! which we need to surround with quotes, to signify it is text. At the end of every JavaScript command, we place a semicolon ; which indicates the end of the command (meaning it doesn't continue on the next row). Although the latter is not compulsory, it's considered good practice which helps find problems more easily.\nImportant: the alert(…) and prompt(…) commands we used, work only in the web browser and are not available in VS Code console applications. If you try using them, you will receive an error. \nThis command is very typical for programming: we signify we need a certain object (the console, in this case) to be found and a certain action ( printing something, passed within brackets, in this case) to be performed on it. In more technical terms, we call the method log(…) from the class console and pass as a parameter to it the text literal Hello JavaScript!.\nStarting The Program\nTo start the program we need to hit [F5]. The result will be displayed on the console, which, for our convenience, will open directly at the bottom of Visual Studio Code:\n\nNotice we run the program with [F5], not [Ctrl + F5]. If we use the latter, we won't be able to see the result because the program will execute very quickly and then disappear.\nThe output from the program is the following text message:\nHello JavaScript!\n\nThe \"Debugging with inspector protocol . . .\" and Debugger listening on... messages are displayed as additional information at the very top of Visual Studio Code's console after the program starts executing. This gives us additional information about the execution which, for the time being, we will ignore. \nTesting in The Judge System\nTesting the solutions to the problems in this book is completely automated via the Judge System's website: https://judge.softuni.org/. The solutions are judged in real-time by the system. Each solution goes through a series of tests that are hidden; every test that passes grants the user certain points.\nThe program we just wrote can be tested here: https://judge.softuni.org/Contests/Practice/Index/926#0.\nEach piece of JavaScript we'd like to test in the Judge System needs to be surrounded by the following lines of code:\nfunction solve() {\n    // we place our code here\n}\n\nIn other words, if we'd like to test the program we just wrote in the system, it will look like this:\nfunction solve() {\n    console.log(\"Hello JavaScript\");\n}\n\nWe need to place the entire source code of the program in the black field and choose JavaScript code, as shown in the screenshot below:\n\nThen we can send our solution by clicking the [Submit] button. The system returns a result in a few seconds which is displayed in the table of submitted solutions. If necessary, we can hit the [Refresh] button at the upper right-hand corner of the table of submitted solutions:\n\nIn that table, the Judge System will display one of the following possible results:\n\nA number of points (between 0 and 100), when the submitted code is compiled successfully (there are no syntactic errors) and can be tested.\nIf our solution is completely correct, all tests are marked in green and we receive 100 points.\nIf our solution is incorrect, some tests are marked in red and we receive less than 100 or 0 points.\n\n\nIf there are syntactic errors in our program, we receive a compile-time error message.\n\nExecuting Code in The Browser Using HTML + JS\nSo far we've seen how to make and execute a console program. Let's now look at how we can write code, which runs in our browser. All the websites you visit are created in a very similar fashion.\nThe principle is very similar to what we just did. The only difference is that when creating a new file, we use the .html extension instead of .js. All that's left is to enclose our code with a opening  and closing  HTML tag. We enclosed our code in much the same way when submitting our code in the Judge System. Here's what our code in Visual Studio Code should now look like:\n\nWith this approach, now we just need to find the helloJS.html file in the location we've saved it, and double click it. It will load in the browser but to see the result, we need to hit F12, which will open the browser's console. Our command prints on the console, so it makes sense that we need to bring it up to see the result. \n\nNow that you've learned how to execute programs, you can test the sample notification programs you have above. Have fun with them, try out different things. Try changing them and playing with them. Swap the console.log(\"Hello JavaScript\"); command for console.error(\"Error occurred\"); and start your program. Note that notification programs can only be executed in our browser and when we try running them from the console, we receive an error. This is because the console doesn't support notification via visual element, like alert.\nTypical Mistakes in JavaScript Programs\nOne of the usual mistakes beginners make is mixing up capital and lowercase letters. However, they matter when we call commands and can impede proper functioning. Here's an example of such a mistake:\nfunction solve() {\n    Console.Log(\"Hello JavaScript\");\n}\n\nIn the example above, Console is written incorrectly and the capital letter needs to be changed to lowercase. Is there another similar mistake in the same example?\nA missing quotation mark or closing bracket can also cause issues – the program will either function improperly or not execute at all. Such mistakes are hard to notice, especially with larger amounts of code. Here's an example:\nfunction solve() {\n    console.log(\"Hello JavaScript);\n}\n\nThis program will return an error after it's started executing and even before that, the code will be underlined by the extensions which monitor syntax, to draw the programmer's attention to the missed closing bracket.\n\nWhat Have We Learned from This Chapter?\nFirst of all, we learned what programming is – issuing commands written in a programming language that the machine can understand and carry out. We also found out what a computer program is – a series of commands that aim to achieve a certain result. We gained some basic knowledge of the JavaScript programming language and learned how to create simple console and web programs using Visual Studio Code. Then we examined JavaScript's program code structure. We looked at printing on the console with the function console.log() and starting the program with [F5]. And last but not least, we now know how to test our code in SoftUni's Judge System.\nTop work! Let's now tackle the exercises. You do remember that learning how to program involves a lot of code writing and problem-solving, right? Let's do just that and put what we've learned into practice.\nFirst Steps in Programming – Problems\nWelcome to the exercises. We are now going to write a few console applications, which will help us make a few more steps into programming. Then we will show you how to program something more complex – programs with graphical and web user interfaces.\nProblem: Expression\nWrite a console-based JavaScript program that calculates and prints the value of the following numerical expression:\n (3522 + 52353) * 23 - (2336 * 501 + 23432 - 6743) * 3 \n\nNote: you are not allowed to previously calculate the value (for example with Windows Calculator).\nHints and Guidelines\nCreate a new JavaScript file and name it expression.js. Then we need to write the code which will calculate the numeric expression above and print its value on the console. Pass the expression to the console.log(...) command by writing it within its brackets:\n\nStart the program with [F5] and check whether the result matches the one from the picture:\n\nTesting in The Judge System\nTest your solution here:\nhttps://judge.softuni.org/Contests/Practice/Index/926#1.\nNote: Don't forget to enclose your code in the solve() function:\nfunction solve() {\n    // your code\n}\n\n\nProblem: Nums 1...20\nWrite a JavaScript console program that prints the numbers from 1 to 20 on separate lines on the console.\nHints and Guidelines\nCreate a new JavaScript file and name it nums1to20.js. Inside the file write 20 console.log() commands, each on a separate line, to print the numbers from 1 to 20 one after another. Some of you may be wondering if there is a cleverer way. Don't worry, there is, but we will mention it later on.\n\nLet's now start the program and check whether the result is what we're expecting:\n1\n2\n…\n20\nTesting in The Judge System\nTest your solution here:\nhttps://judge.softuni.org/Contests/Practice/Index/926#2.\nDid you receive 100 points? If not, think of what you may be missing. Then try and think of a cleverer way to write this program, to avoid repeating the same command so many times. Look up information for \"for loop JavaScript\" on the Internet.\nProblem: Triangle of 55 Stars\nWrite a JavaScript console program that prints a triangle of 55 stars on 10 lines:\n*\n**\n***\n****\n*****\n******\n*******\n********\n*********\n**********\nHints and Guidelines\nCreate a new JavaScript file and name it triangleOf55Stars.js. Inside we need to write code that prints our triangle, for example by using 10 print commands, like in the example below:\nconsole.log(\"*\");\nconsole.log(\"**\");\n…\n\nTesting in The Judge System\nTest your solution here:\nhttps://judge.softuni.org/Contests/Practice/Index/926#3.\nTry and improve your solution to avoid repeating the same command so many times. Can this be achieved with a for-loop? Did you manage to invent a better solution (with a for-loop, for example) to the previous problem? The current problem can be solved with a similar, but a little more complex approach (a loop within another loop). It's completely fine if you can't figure it out, you'll remember this problem when we learn about loops in a few chapters.\nProblem: Rectangle Area\nWrite a JavaScript program that receives two numbers a and b, then calculates and prints the area of a rectangle with sides a and b.\nSample Input and Output\n\n\n\na\nb\narea\n\n\n\n\n2\n7\n14\n\n\n7\n8\n56\n\n\n12\n5\n60\n\n\n\nHints and Guidelines\nCreate a new JavaScript file. For now, programs of similar type will be tested only in the Judge System, which has a built-in mechanism for passing input data to the program. To receive the two numbers, we need to declare our request by changing the enclosing code (the solve() function) we got used to writing:\n\nDid you notice the change? We placed additional square brackets within the brackets of the function, inside which we described what data we're expecting to receive – in this case the numbers a and b, set as an array.\nWhat's left is to finish the program so it can calculate the rectangle's area and print it. Pass the product of a and b to the familiar console.log() command. In programming, we multiply using the * operator.\nTesting in The Judge System\nTest your solution here:\nhttps://judge.softuni.org/Contests/Practice/Index/926#4.\n* Problem: Square of Stars\nWrite a JavaScript console program that receives a whole positive number N and prints a square of N stars on the console, like in the examples below.\nSample Input and Output\n\n\n\nInput\nOutput\nInput\nOutput\nInput\nOutput\n\n\n\n\n3\n**** ****\n4\n*****  **  *****\n5\n******   **   **   ******\n\n\n\nHints and Guidelines\nCreate a new JavaScript console program:\n\nFinish the program so that it prints a square made up of stars. You may need to use for-loops. Search for additional information on the Internet.\nCaution: this task is more difficult than the rest and is presented to you at this point purposefully. It's marked with a star, To provoke you to look for information on the Internet. This is one of the most important skills you have to develop while you're learning to program. This is what you'll be doing every day if you work as a developer, so don't be scared, try it out. If you're having difficulties, you can also ask for help in the SoftUni Reddit: https://www.reddit.com/r/softuni/.\nTesting in The Judge System\nTest your solution here:\nhttps://judge.softuni.org/Contests/Practice/Index/926#5.\nConsole, Graphical and Web Applications\nWith console applications, as you've already noticed, all operations for reading input and printing output are done on the console. The input data is entered on the console and then it is read by the application; the console is also used to print the output data after or during the runtime of the program.\nWhile a console application uses the text console, web applications use a web-based user interface. To execute them, two things are needed – a web server and a web browser. The browser plays the main role in the visualization of data and interaction with the user. Web applications are much more pleasant for the user, they look better, and a mouse and touch screen can be used (for tablets and smartphones). Programming stands under all of that, of course. This is why we need to learn how to program and we have already made our first tiny steps toward achieving that.\nGraphical (GUI) applications have a visual user interface, directly on your computer or mobile device, without a web browser. Graphical applications (also known as desktop applications) contain one or more graphical windows where certain controllers are located (text fields, buttons, pictures, tables, and others), which allow dialog with the user to be more intuitive. Similar to them are mobile applications on your smartphone or tablet: we use forms, text fields, buttons, and other controls, and we manage them with program code. This is why we learn to write code now: code is everywhere in software development.\nExercises: Web Applications\nWe will now build a basic web application and after that, a simple graphical application, To have a look at what we will be able to create once we progress with programming and software development. We are not going to examine the techniques and constructions used in much detail. Rather, we are just going to have a peek at the arrangement and functionality of what we've created. After we progress with our knowledge, we will be able to develop bigger and more complex software applications and systems. We hope that the examples given below will boost your interest, rather than make you give up.\nProblem: Web Application Numbers Summator'\nWrite a Web application that calculates the sum of two numbers. \nAfter the numbers are entered in the first text fields, and the button [Calculate] is clicked, calculate their sum and display the result in the third text field. For our application, we'll use HTML technology which in combination with the JavaScript programming language, allows for the creation of web applications and sites, in the Visual Studio Code programming environment.\nHTML is a descriptive language that is used to declare the content of a website. Without going into too much detail, we'll just mention that HTML is based on the use of combinations of tags to visualize and give semanticity to the content. In one of our previous examples, we already created an HTML page by utilizing the  tag.\nNotice that we'll be creating a web-based application. This is an application accessible through a web browser, exactly like your favorite webmail or news site. The web application will have a server-side (Back-end), written in JavaScript, and a client-side (front-end), written in HTML. The Web application is expected to look similar to the following:\n\nAs opposed to console applications that read and write data in the form of text on the console, Web applications have a Web-based user interface. Web applications are loaded from some Internet address (URL) through a standard web browser. Users write input data on a page, visualized by the web browser, the data is processed on a web server and the results are shown again on a page in the web browser. As we mentioned we'll be using HTML and JavaScript for our web application. Other technologies which support creating web applications are ASP.NET MVC technology, PHP technology, etc. These technologies make creating the general application architecture – the server, as well as the client-side, much easier.\nLet's move on to realizing our web application.\nCreate a new HTML file in VS Code and name it sumator.html.\n\nThen write the following code:\n\nThis code creates one web form containing three text fields and a button. It's specified that pressing the [Calculate] button will call the calculate action.\nLet's examine the code we just wrote.\n\nOn the first 2 rows, we declare that we're describing an HTML page, using the  and  tags, the latter declaring the start of our page's body – it's the main part that will be visualized. Respectively, the last 2 rows represent the corresponding closing tags, which declare the end of that particular part of our HTML page. Look more closely and you'll notice they're different from the opening tags – they have a forward slash '/' before the tag name - , for example.\nUsing HTML tags in our page's body we'll describe what we want to be visualized on our webpage – three fields where numbers can be entered. This can be achieved with the  tag. Using this tag we declare that we want the input of type number to be visualized. The additional attribute – id, serves to let us determine a unique name for this tag. What we decide to call it is completely up to us. We'll need the id attribute later to get hold of information about this particular HTML element.\nThen, on the 7th row we have another input tag declared, but this time it's of type button. This is how we indicate we want an element that, upon being clicked, produces some result. \nLet's now also look at the JavaScript code we wrote:\n\nFirst, we declare the calculate() function which reads the information from our first two text fields (from our HTML page), then calculates their sum and assigns it as the third field's value. The function spans from the 9th to the 17th row. We'll learn what functions are, how they're declared and called, in this book's following chapters.\nLooking more closely at the function's body, we observe that on the 10th row the variable firstNumber is declared and then the value of the text field with id=firstNumber is assigned to it. The parseInt(…) function makes sure that the text that's been entered will be converted to a number. Then similarly, we get the value of our second text field (with id=secondNumber). Finally, using the same mechanism, instead of obtaining the value of the third field with id=result, we assign a value to it by placing it on the left side of the equation.\nThen on the 19th and 20th row we access our button and tell it to listen for click events which, when received, will trigger the function calculate() we just declared. In other words, when we use our mouse to click the button, the calculate() function will execute.\nThe application is ready. We can start it by finding its location and opening it. It will load inside the browser by default. \nDoes this seem frightening? There's no need to be scared! We have a lot more to learn, to reach the level of knowledge and skills required to write web-based applications with ease like in the example above, as well as much bigger and more complex applications. If it all makes little sense, just keep going without worrying. In time, you will remember with a smile how incomprehensible and exciting your first collision with web programming was. If you're having issues with the example above, watch the video at the beginning of this chapter – the application is created step by step and explained in great detail. You can also ask for assistance in the SoftUni Reddit: https://www.reddit.com/r/softuni/.\nThe purpose of the example above (web application) is not to teach you, but to allow you to dive a little deeper into programming, to fuel your interest in software development, and to inspire you to study hard. You have a lot more to learn, but it is interesting, isn't it?\n"},"chapter-02-simple-calculations.html":{"url":"chapter-02-simple-calculations.html","title":"2.1. Simple Calculations","keywords":"","body":"Chapter 2.1. Simple Calculations\nIn this chapter we are going to get familiar with the following concepts and programming techniques:\n\nHow to work with data types and variables which we need when processing numbers and strings.\nHow to print a result on the screen.\nHow to read a custom input.\nHow to do simple arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, concatenate strings.\nHow to round numbers.\n\nCalculations in Programming\nWe know that computers are machines that process data. All data is stored in the computer memory (RAM) in variables. Variables are named memory areas that store data of a certain type, for example, number or string. Each variable in JavaScript has a name and value. Here is how we would define a variable by assigning it a value at the same time as declaring it:\n\nAfter processing, the data is stored again in variables (i.e. somewhere in the memory set aside by our program).\nData Types and Variables\nIn programming each variable stores a certain value of a particular type. For example, data types can be a number, string (text), a boolean type, data, list, etc.\nHere are some examples of data types and values for them:\n\nnumber - type of number: 1, 42, -5, 3.14, NaN, …\nstring - type of text (string): 'Hello', \"Hi\", 'Beer', …\nboolean - boolean type: true, false\nDate - date: Tue Jul 04 2017, ……\n\nJavaScript language has three keywords for declaring a variable - var, const, and let. The main difference between let and var is in the scope of the variable. We use const when we are sure that what we assign to the variable will not change. A little further in the book, we will find out more details about the range of variables but for now, we will use the word let to declare a new variable.\nPrint a Result on The Screen\nFor printing text, number, or another result on the screen, it's necessary to call the built-in method console.log(). With it we can print both the value of a variable and directly text or number:\nconsole.log(42); // prints number\n\nconsole.log('Hello!'); // prints string\n\nlet msg = 'Hello, JavaScript!';\nconsole.log(msg); // prints a value of variable\n\nReading a User Input as an Integer:\nFor reading a user input as a number is necessary to define an argument of our function:\nfunction sum([arg1, arg2]) {\n    let a = parseInt(arg1);\n    let b = parseInt(arg2);\n    ...\n}\n\nLet's note that the arguments arg1 and arg2 can be a different data type than the one we want. That's why it's necessary to convert them into a suitable one. If it's not done for the program each number will be just a string with which we can't do operations arithmetic operations.\nProblem: Square Area\nFor example, let's look at the following function which reads an integer from the console, multiplies it by itself (squares it), and prints the result from the multiplication. That's how we can calculate square area by side length:\nfunction calculateSquareArea([arg1]) {\n    let a = parseInt(arg1);\n    let area = a * a;\n    console.log('Square area = ' + area);\n}\n\nIf we call our function with parameter 3 - calculateSquareArea([3]) the result will be - Square area = 9. Here's how our code looks like in action in the web browser's JavaScript console:\n\nIf we try to write a wrong number, for example, \"hello\", we will get an error message during runtime (exception). This is normal. Later on, we will find out how we can catch these kinds of errors and make the user enter a number again.\nHow Does The Example Work?\nOn the first line with function calculateSquareArea([arg1]) { we define our function by giving it a name and setting arguments that it needs. In our case, we have one argument which is the side of the square.\nOn the next line with let a = parseInt(arg1); we get the argument of the function arg1 and convert it to an integer with the method parseInt(arg1);. The result is saved in variable a.\nNote: If arg1 contains a floating-point number, that will be rounded to an integer. Converting a floating number to an integer is performed by removing all digits after the decimal point. Example: parseInt(2.3) = 2, parseInt(3.8) = 3\nThe next command let area = a * a; is saved in a new variable named area - the result of the multiplication a by a.\nThe next command console.log('Square area = ' + area); prints the specified text by placing the calculated face of the square, which we have saved in the variable area next to it.\nThe above program can be simplified a bit, like this:\nfunction calculateSquareArea([a]) {\n  let area = a * a;\n  console.log(\"Square area = \" + area);\n}\n\nThe above code will work correctly because when multiplied, the variable a will be converted to a number. When the input is only a single number, the parentheses [] can also be skipped, like this:\nfunction calculateSquareArea(a) {\n  let area = a * a;\n  console.log(\"Square area = \" + area);\n}\n\nThe code can be compact even more, like this:\nfunction calculateSquareArea(a) {\n  console.log(\"Square area = \" + a * a);\n}\n\nTesting in The Judge System\nTest your solution here: https://judge.softuni.org/Contests/Practice/Index/927#0. Try all four solutions to the problem.\nReading Floating-Point Numbers\nTo read user input as floating-point number it's necessary again to define an argument to our function. The syntax is similar to reading an integer, but here we have to use the function parseFloat(...):\nfunction sum([arg1, arg2]) {\n    let a = parseFloat(arg1);\n    let b = parseFloat(arg2);\n    ...\n}\n\nProblem: Inches to Centimeters\nLet's write a function that reads a floating-point number in inches and converts it to centimeters::\nfunction convertInchesToCentimeters([arg1]) {\n    let inches = parseFloat(arg1);\n    let centimeters = inches * 2.54;\n    console.log('Centimeters = ' + centimeters);\n}\n\nLet's call the function and make sure that when passing a value in inches, we get the correct result in centimeters:\nconvertInchesToCentimeters([5]); // Centimeters = 12.7\n\nTesting in The Judge System\nTest your solution here: https://judge.softuni.org/Contests/Practice/Index/927#1.\nReading a Text Input\nSame with other data types, to read a string it's necessary to define an argument to our function and after that assign it to a variable:\nfunction print([arg1]) {\n    let text = arg1;\n    ...\n}\n\nProblem: Greeting by Name\nLet's write a program that asks the user for their name and salutes them with the text \"Hello, (name)\".\nfunction sayHello([arg1]) {\n    let name = arg1;\n    console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`);\n}\n\nIn this case, the expression ${name} will be replaced with the value of the variable name. If we call the function with the name \"Ivan\", that will be the result:\nsayHello(['Ivan']); // Hello, Ivan!\n\nTesting in Judge System\nTest your solution here: https://judge.softuni.org/Contests/Practice/Index/927#2.\nConcatenating Text and Numbers\nWhen printing text, numbers and other data we can concatenate them by using templates `variable = ${variable}` . In programming these templates are called placeholders. Pay attention: We need to use italicized apostrophes ` (backticks) instead of normal quotes to recognize the template:\nfunction printInfo([firstName, lastName, age, town]) {\n    console.log(`You are ${firstName} ${lastName}, a ${age}-years old person from ${town}.`);\n}\n\nWe call the function with test parameters again and make sure that it works:\nprintInfo(['Ivan', 'Ivanov', 20, 'Sofia']);\n\nExcept for variables, we can make simple calculations in the templates.\nThe same variable can be used as a template more than once. Here's an example:\nlet a = 1;\nconsole.log(`${a} + ${a} = ${a + a}`);\n\nThe result is:\n1 + 1 = 2\nTesting in The Judge System\nTest your solution here: https://judge.softuni.org/Contests/Practice/Index/927#3.\nArithmetic Operations\nLet's examine the basic arithmetic operations in programming.\nSumming Numbers (operator +)\nWe can sum numbers using the operator +:\nlet a = 5;\nlet b = 7;\nlet sum = a + b; // the result is 12\n\nSubtracting Numbers (Operator -)\nSubtracting numbers is done using the - operator:\nfunction substractNumbers([arg1, arg2]) {\n    let a = parseInt(a);\n    let b = parseInt(b);\n    let result = a - b;\n    console.log(result);\n}\n\nLet we check the result of the execution of this program (with numbers 10 and 3):\nsubstractNumbers([10, 3]); // 7\n\nMultiplying Numbers (Operator *)\nFor multiplication of numbers we use the * operator:\nlet a = 5;\nlet b = 7;\nlet product = a * b; // 35\n\nDividing Numbers (Operator /)\nDividing numbers is done using the / operator.\nNote: Float numbers divided by 0 do not cause an exception and the result is +/- infinity or the special value Infinity.\nHere are a few examples with the division operator:\nconsole.log(10 / 2.5); // Result: 4\nconsole.log(10 / 4);   // Result: 2.5\nconsole.log(10 / 6);   // Result: 1.6666666666666667\n\nconsole.log(a / 0);   // Result: Infinity\nconsole.log(-a / 0);  // Result: -Infinity\nconsole.log(0 / 0);   // Result: NaN (Not a Number), i.e. the result\n                      // The operation  hasn't a valid numeric value\n\nConcatenating Text and Numbers\nBesides summing up numbers, the operator + is also used for joining pieces of text (concatenation of two strings one after another). In programming, joining two pieces of text is called \"concatenation\". Here is how we can concatenate a text with a number by the + operator:\nlet firstName = \"Maria\";\nlet lastName = \"Ivanova\";\nlet age = 19;\nlet str = firstName + \" \" + lastName + \" @ \" + age;\nconsole.log(str);  // Maria Ivanova @ 19\n\nHere is another example:\nlet a = 1.5;\nlet b = 2.5;\nlet sum = \"The sum is: \" + a + b;\nconsole.log(sum);  // The sum is: 1.52.5\n\nDo you notice anything strange? Maybe you expected the numbers  a  and b  to sum? The concatenation works from left to right and the above result is correct. If we want to sum the numbers, we will have to use brackets to change the order of operations:\nlet a = 1.5;\nlet b = 2.5;\nlet sum = \"The sum is: \" + (a + b);\nconsole.log(sum);  // The sum is: 4\n\nNumerical Expressions\nIn programming, we can calculate numerical expressions, for example:\nlet expr = (3 + 5) * (4 – 2);\n\nThe standard rule for priorities of arithmetic operations is applied: multiplying and dividing are always done before adding and subtracting. In the case of an expression in brackets, it is calculated first but we already know all of that from the school math.\nProblem: Concatenate Data\nWrite a function, that receives a first name, last name, age and city and prints a message of the following kind:\nYou are  , a -years old person from .\n\nHints and Guidelines\nWe write a function that receives the input in the following order:\n\nThe code that prints the message described in the problem requirements should be finished.\nIn the picture above the code is blurred on purpose, in order for you to think of a way to finish it yourself.\nNext, the solution should be tested locally using [Ctrl+F5].\nTesting in The Judge System\nTest your solution here: https://judge.softuni.org/Contests/Practice/Index/927#3.\nProblem: Trapeziod Area\nLet's write a program that inputs the lengths of the two bases of a trapezoid and its height (one floating-point number per line) and calculates the trapezoid area by the standard math formula:\nfunction printTrapezoidArea([arg1, arg2, arg3]) {\n    let b1 = parseFloat(arg1);\n    let b2 = parseFloat(arg2);\n    let h = parseFloat(arg3);\n    let area = (b1 + b2) * h / 2;\n    console.log(\"Trapezoid area = \" + area);\n}\n\nBecause we want our function to work with both integers and floating numbers, we use parseFloat(). If we start the function and enter values for sides: 3, 4, and 5, we will obtain the following result::\nprintTrapezoidArea([3, 4, 5]); // Trapezoid area = 17.5\n\nTesting in The Judge System\nTest your solution here:\nhttps://judge.softuni.org/Contests/Practice/Index/927#4.\nRounding Numbers\nSometimes when we work with floating numbers, it's necessary to bring them to integers. This bringing is named rounding. The programming language JavaScript provides us with several methods for rounding numbers:\n\nMath.ceil(…) - rounding up to next (greater) integer:\n\nlet up = Math.ceil(45.15); // up = 46\n\n\nMath.floor(…) - rounding down to previous (less) integer:\n\nlet down = Math.floor(45.67);    // down = 45\n\n\nMath.trunc(…) - cutting the decimal places:\n\nlet trunc = Math.trunc(45.67); // trunc = 45\n\n\nMath.round(…) - rounding is done as a basic rule for rounding numbers - if the decimal part is less than 5, rounding is to the previous number and if it's greater than 5 - to the next:\n\nMath.round(5.439); // 5\nMath.round(5.539); // 6\n\n\n.toFixed([number of characters after the decimal point]) - rounding to the closest number:\n\n(123.456).toFixed(2);     // 123.46\n(123).toFixed(2);         // 123.00\n(123.456).toFixed(0);     // 123\n(123.512).toFixed(0);     // 124\n\nProblem: Circle Area and Perimeter\nLet's write a function that receives an input of the radius r of a circle and calculates the area and the perimeter of the circle.\nFormulas:\n\nArea = π * r * r\nPerimeter = 2 * π * r\nπ ≈ 3.14159265358979323846…\n\nfunction calculateCircleAreaAndPerimeter([arg1]) {\n    let r = parseInt(arg1);\n    console.log(\"Area = \" + Math.PI * r * r);\n    // Math.PI - Built-in JavaScript constant for the value of the number π\n    console.log(\"Perimeter = \" + 2 * Math.PI * r);\n}\n\nLet's call the function with radius r = 10:\ncalculateCircleAreaAndPerimeter([10])\n\nThe result is:\n\nTesting in The Judge System\nTest your solution here: https://judge.softuni.org/Contests/Practice/Index/927#5.\nProblem: 2D Rectangle Area\nThe rectangle is given with the coordinates of two of its opposite angles. Calculate its area and perimeter :\n\nIn this problem, we have to consider that if we subtract the smaller x from the bigger x , we will obtain the length of the rectangle. Identically, if we subtract the smaller y from the bigger y, , we will obtain the height of the rectangle. What is left is to multiply both sides. Here is an example of an implementation of the described logic:\nfunction calculateRectangleArea([arg1, arg2, arg3, arg4]) {\n    let x1 = parseFloat(arg1);\n    let y1 = parseFloat(arg2);\n    let x2 = parseFloat(arg3);\n    let y2 = parseFloat(arg4);\n\n    // Calculating the sides of the rectangle:\n    let width = Math.max(x1, x2) - Math.min(x1, x2);\n    let height = Math.max(y1, y2) - Math.min(y1, y2);\n\n    console.log(width * height);\n    console.log(2 * (width + height));\n}\n\nWe use the method Math.max(x1, x2) to find the higher value from x1 and x2 and identically Math.min(y1, y2) to find the lower of both values.\nLet we call the function with testing values from the coordinate system:\ncalculateRectangleArea([60, 20, 10, 50]); // 1500\n                                          // 160\n\nTesting in The Judge System\nTest your solution here: https://judge.softuni.org/Contests/Practice/Index/927#6.\nExercises: Simple Calculations\nLet's strengthen the knowledge gained throughout this chapter with a few more exercises.\nEmpty JS File for our Solution of the Problem in Visual Studio Code\nWe start by creating an empty JS file in Visual Studio Code.

In it, we will use calculations with floating-point numbers.\nWeb Application: *** Converter - BGN to EUR!\nCreate a web application that calculates the value in Euro (EUR) of the monetary amount given in Bulgarian levs (BGN). By changing the amount in BGN, the amount in EUR has to be recalculated automatically. Use the fixed-rate BGN / Euro: 1.95583.\n\nSimilarly, as in the first chapter (\"First Steps in Programming\"), we will use the languages JavaScript, HTML, and CSS for our application.\n\nThe first step is to create a folder in which we will store all the files that are needed for our application.\nThen we need to create an HTML file in the folder: index.html\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n    BGN to EUR Converter\n  \n  \n    \n      BGN to EUR Converter\n      \n        \n          BGN: \n          \n        \n        \n          EUR: \n          \n        \n        \n      \n    \n  \n\n\nNote that each HTML page must have a specific structure. For example, always the main code we write is in the tag , and always the title of the page is in the tag .\n\nWe have the structure of the page, it remains to add a JavaScript file with the logic itself. We create a new file and name it converter.js\n\nfunction eurConverter() {\n    let bgn = document.getElementById(\"bgn\").value;\n    let eur = (bgn / 1.95583).toFixed(2);\n    document.getElementById(\"euro\").value = eur;\n}\n\n\nOnce we have the logic of the application, we need to find a way to tell where to use it. To do this we need to make 2 changes to the existing index.html file:\n\nFirst, we add the following line just below the title tag, through which the connection between the files is made index.html and converter.js:\n\n\nAnd second, we find and replace the input field with the type button with the following code. In this way we set when clicking on the button [Convert!] to call the function eurConverter():\n\n\nIf we start the file index.html from the folder, we should have a working application that converts from BGN to EUR:\n\nLet's make it more beautiful.\n\nWe create a new file with extension *.css and name index. CSS is used to stylize the elements in HTML. We open the file index.html and add this line in the tag :\n\n\n\nIn the file index.css we write the following code (we define styles for the individual elements of the HTML format):\nbody {\n  font-family: \"Lato\", sans-serif;\n  color: #ffffff;\n}\n\n.content-form {\n  width: 50%;\n  margin: 5% auto;\n  background: #234465;\n  padding: 5px 10px 10px;\n  border-radius: 15px;\n  box-shadow: 5px 5px 10px #808080, 5px 5px 10px #6793c1 inset;\n}\n\n.currency-value {\n  border: none;\n  padding: 5px;\n  border-radius: 5px;\n}\n\n.title {\n  text-align: center;\n}\n\n.item-currency {\n  font-weight: 700;\n}\n\n.currency {\n  margin: auto;\n  padding-bottom: 15px;\n}\n\n.items {\n  display: flex;\n  flex-direction: column;\n  justify-content: flex-start;\n}\n\n.primary-btn {\n  margin: auto;\n  border: none;\n  padding: 10px 30px;\n  border-radius: 10px;\n  background-color: #ffa000;\n  color: #ffffff;\n  font-weight: 700;\n}\n\n\nStart the file index.html:\n\n\nWeb Application: *** Catch The Mouse!\nUpon moving the mouse cursor onto the button, it moves to a random position.

Simple Calculations – Exam Problems","keywords":"","body":"Chapter 2.2. Simple Calculations – Exam Problems\nIn the previous chapter, we explained how to pass numbers to functions and how to print the output in the console. We went through the main arithmetical operations and briefly mentioned data types. In this chapter, we are going to practice what we have learned by solving a few more complex exam problems.\nReading Numbers\nBefore going to the tasks, we are going to revise the most important aspects of what we have studied in the previous chapter. We will start by creating a function, which will read a number.\nReading an Integer\nWe need to create a function, which will get one argument arg1. We will create a variable in the function, where we will store the number (for example num), combined with the method parseInt(…), which converts a string to an integer:\nfunction readNumber(arg1) {\n  let num = parseInt(arg1);\n}\n\nReading a Floating-Point Number\nThe same way we read an integer one, but this time we use the method parseFloat(…):\nlet num = parseFloat(arg1);\n\nPrinting Text Using Placeholders (placeholder)\nA placeholder is an expression that is replaced with a particular value while printing an output. For this placeholder to work, we will have to use backticks `…` . The method console.log(…) supports printing a string based on a placeholder, where the first arguments, which have to be printed are written in the ${…}:\nlet firstName = \"Ivan\";\nlet lastName = \"Ivanov\";\nlet age = 19;\nlet town = \"Sofia\";\nconsole.log(`You are ${firstName} ${lastName}, a ${age}-years old person from ${town}.`);\n// You are Ivan Ivanov, a 19-years old person from Sofia.\n\nArithmetic Operators\nLet's revise the main arithmetic operators for simple calculations.\nOperator +\nlet result = 3 + 5; // the result is 8\n\nOperator -\nlet result = 3 - 5; // the result is -2\n\nOperator *\nlet result = 3 * 5; // the result is 15\n\nOperator /\nlet result2 = 5 / 2; // the result is 2.5 (floating-point division)\n\nConcatenation\nBy using the operator + between string variables (or between a string and a number), concatenation is being performed (combining strings):\nlet firstName = \"Ivan\";\nlet lastName = \"Ivanov\";\nlet age = 19;\nlet str = firstName + \" \" + lastName + \" is \" + age + \" years old\";\n// Ivan Ivanov is 19 years old\n\nExam Problems\nNow, after having revised how to make simple calculations and how to read and print numbers from the console, let's go to the tasks. We will solve a few problems from a practical exam in SoftUni.\nProblem: Training Lab\nA training lab has a rectangular size l x w meters, without columns on the inside. The hall is divided into two parts- left and right, with a hallway approximately in the middle. In both parts, there are rows with desks. In the back of the hall, there is a big entrance door. In the front, there is a podium for the lecturer. A single working place takes up 70 x 120 cm (a table with size 70 x 40 cm + space for a chair and passing through with size 70 x 80 cm). The hallway width is at least 100 cm. It is calculated that due to the entrance door (which has 160 cm opening) exactly one working space is lost, and due to the podium (which has a size of 160 x 120 cm) exactly two working spaces are lost. Write a program that reads the size of the training lab as input parameters and calculates the number of working places in it (look at the figure).\nInput Data\nThe program reads two numbers (arguments), one per line: l (length in meters) and w (width in meters).\nConstraints: 3 ≤ w ≤ l ≤ 100.\nOutput Data\nPrint an integer in the console: the number of working places in the training lab.\nSample Input and Output\n\n\n\nInput\nOutput\nFigure\n\n\n\n\n158.9\n129\n\n\n\n8.45.2\n39\n\n\n\n\nClarification of the Examples\nIn the first example, the hall length is 1500 cm. 12 rows can be situated in it (12  120 cm = 1440 + 60 cm difference). The hall width is 890 cm. 100 cm of them are for the hallway in the middle. The rest 790 cm can be situated by 11 desks per row (11 \\ 70 cm = 770 cm + 20 cm difference). Number of places = 12 * 11 - 3 = 132 - 3 = 129 (we have 12 rows with 11 working places = 132 minus 3 places for podium and entrance door).\nIn the second example, the hall length is 840 cm. 7 rows can be situated in it (7 * 120 cm = 840, no difference). The hall width is 520 cm. 100 cm from them is for the hallway in the middle. The rest 420 cm can be situated by 6 desks per row (6 * 70 cm = 420 cm, no difference). Number of places = 7 * 6 - 3 = 42 - 3 = 39 (we have 7 rows with 6 working places = 42 minus 3 places for podium and entrance door).\nHints and Guidelines\nTry to solve the problem on your own first. If you do not succeed, go through the hints.\nIdea for Solution\nAs with any programming task, it is important to build an idea for its solution, before having started to write code. Let's carefully go through the problem requirements. We have to write a program that calculates the number of working places in a training lab, where the number depends on the hall length and height. We notice that the provided input data will be in meters and the information about how much space the working places and hallway take, will be in centimeters. To do the calculations, we will use the same measuring units, no matter whether we choose to convert length and height into centimeters or the other data in meters. The first option is used for the presented solution. \nNext, we have to calculate how many columns and how many rows with desks will fit. We can calculate the columns by subtracting the width by the necessary space for the hallway (100 cm) and divide the difference by 70 cm (the length of a workplace). We find the rows by dividing the length by 120 cm. Both operations can result in a real number with a whole and a fractional part, but we have to store only the whole part in a variable. In the end, we multiply the number of rows by the number of columns and divide it by 3 (the lost places for entrance door and podium). This is how we calculate the needed value.\nChoosing Data Types\nFrom the example, we see that a real number with whole and fractional part can be given as an input, but in JavaScript, there is only one primitive type of number (Number), therefore, this will not be a problem. Choosing a data type for the next variables depends on the method we choose to solve the problem. As with any programming task, this one has more than one way to be solved.\nSolution\nIt is time to go to the solution. We can divide it into three smaller tasks:\n\nReading input from the console.\nDoing the calculations.\nPrinting the output on the console.\n\nThe first thing we have to do is read the input from the console. We create a function, which will get two arguments. Then we need to save their values in two variables by using the method parseFloat(…) to convert the string (text) value into a fractional number:\n\nLet's move to the calculations. The special part here is that after having divided the numbers, we have to store only the whole part of the result in a variable.\n\nSearch in Google! Whenever we have an idea how to solve a particular problem, but we do not know how to write it in JavaScript or we are dealing with one that many other people have had before us, the easiest way to solve it is by looking for information on the Internet.\n\n\nIn this case, we can try with the following search: \"JavaScript get whole number part of double\". One possible way is to use the method Math.trunc(…). The code down below is blurred on purpose and it should be completed by the reader:\n\nWith console.log(…) we print the result in the console:\n\nTesting in The Judge System\nTest your solution here: https://judge.softuni.org/Contests/Practice/Index/928#0.\nProblem: Vegetable Market\nA gardener is selling his harvest on the vegetable market. He is selling vegetables for N BGN per kilogram and fruits for M BGN per kilogram. Write a program that calculates the earnings of the harvest in Euro. (Assume that 1 EUR is equal to 1.94 BGN).\nInput Data\nFour arguments are passed to the function:\n\nVegetable price per kilogram – a floating-point number.\nFruit price per kilogram – a floating-point number.\nTotal kilograms of vegetables – an integer.\nTotal kilograms of fruits – an integer.\n\nConstraints: all numbers will be within the range from 0.00 to 1000.00.\nOutput Data\nPrint on the console one floating-point number: the earnings of all fruits and vegetables in EUR.\nSample Input and Output\n\n\n\nInput\nOutput\n\n\n\n\n0.19419.41010\n101\n\n\n\nClarification for the first example:\n\nVegetables cost: 0.194 BGN. * 10 kg. = 1.94 BGN.\nFruits cost: 19.4 BGN. * 10 kg.  = 194 BGN.\nTotal: 195.94 BGN. = 101 EUR. \n\n\n\n\nInput\nOutput\n\n\n\n\n1.52.51010\n20.6185567010309\n\n\n\nHints and Guidelines\nFirst, we will give a few ideas, followed by particular hints for solving the problem and the essential part of the code.\nIdea for Solution\nLet's first go through the problem requirements. In this case, we have to calculate the total income from the harvest. It equals the sum of the earnings from the fruits and vegetables which we can calculate by multiplying the price per kilogram by the quantity. The input is given in BGN and the output should be in euros. It is assumed that 1 EUR equals 1.94 BGN, therefore, to get the wanted output value, we have to divide the sum by 1.94.\nChoosing Data Types\nAfter we have a clear idea of how to solve the task, we can continue with choosing appropriate data types. Let's go through the input: we have two integers for total kilograms of vegetables and fruits, therefore, the variables we declare to store their values can be converted to numbers with parseInt(…). The prices of the fruits and vegetables are said to be floating-point numbers and therefore, the variables will be converted by using the method parseFloat(…).\nSolution\nIt is time to get to the solution. We can divide it into three smaller tasks:\n\nReading input from the console.\nDoing the calculations.\nPrinting the output on the console.\n\nTo read the input, we declare variables, which we have to name carefully so that they can give us a hint about the values they store. With the methods parseInt(…) and parseFloat(…), we convert the particular string value into int and double.\n\nWe do the necessary calculations:\n\nThe task does not specify a special output format, therefore, we just have to calculate the requested value and print it on the console. As in mathematics and so in programming, the division has a priority over addition. However, in this task, first, we have to calculate the sum of the two input values and then divide by 1.94. To give priority to addition, we can use brackets. With console.log(…) we print the output on the console:\n\nTesting in The Judge System\nTest your solution here: https://judge.softuni.org/Contests/Practice/Index/928#1.\nProblem: Change Tiles\nOn the ground in front of an apartment building tiles need to be placed. The ground has a square shape with a side of N meters. The tiles are \"W\" meters wide and \"L\" meters long. There is one bench on the ground with a width of \"M\" meters and a length of \"O\" meters. There is no need to place tiles under it. Each tile is replaced for 0.2 minutes.\nWrite a program that reads from the console the size of the ground, the tiles, and the bench, and calculates how many tiles are needed to cover the ground and what is the total time for placing all of the tiles.\nExample: ground with size 20 m has an area of 400 m2m^2m​2​​. A bench that is 1 m wide and 2 m long, has an area of 2 m2m^2m​2​​. One tile is 5 m wide and 4 m long and has an area of 20 m2m^2m​2​​. The space that needs to be covered is 400 - 2 = 398 m2m^2m​2​​. 398 / 20 = 19.90 tiles are necessary. The time needed is 19.90 * 0.2 = 3.98 minutes.\nInput Data\n5 arguments are passed to the function:\n\nN – length of a side of the ground within the range of [1 … 100].\nW – width per tile within the range of [0.1 … 10.00].\nL – length per tile within the range of [0.1 … 10.00].\nM – width of the bench within the range of [0 … 10].\nO – length of the bench within the range of [0 … 10].\n\nOutput Data\nPrint on the console two numbers:\n\nnumber of tiles needed for the repair\ntotal time for placing them\n\nEach number should be on a new line and rounded to the second decimal place.\nSample Input and Output\n\n\n\nInput\nOutput\n\n\n\n\n205412\n19.93.98\n\n\n\nExplanation of the example:\n\nTotal area = 20 * 20 = 400.\nArea of the bench = 1 * 2 = 2.\nArea for covering = 400 – 2 = 398.\nArea of tiles = 5 * 4 = 20.\nNeeded tiles = 398 \\/ 20 = 19.9.\nNeeded time = 19.9 * 0.2 = 3.98.\n\n\n\n\nInput\nOutput\n\n\n\n\n400.80.635\n3302.08660.42\n\n\n\nHints and Guidelines\nLet's make a draft to clarify the task requirements. It can look the following way:\n\nIdea for Solution\nIt is required to calculate the number of tiles that have to be placed, as well as the time for placing them. To find that number, we have to calculate the area that needs to be covered and divide it by the area per tile. By the requirements of the problem, the ground is square, therefore, we find the total area by multiplying its side by its value  N * N. After that, we calculate the area that the bench takes up by multiplying its two sides as well M * O. After subtracting the area of the bench from the area of the whole ground, we obtain the area that needs to be repaired.\nWe calculate the area of a single tile by multiplying its two sides with one another W * L. As we already stated, now we have to divide the area for covering by the area of a single tile. This way, we find the number of necessary tiles. We multiply it by 0.2 (the time needed for changing a tile). Now, we have the wanted output.\nChoosing Data Types\nThe length of the side of the ground, the width, and the length of the bench will be given as integers, therefore, to store their values, we can declare variables converted by the method parseInt(…). We will be given floating-point numbers for the width and the length of the tiles and this is why we will use parseFloat(…).\nSolution\nAs in the previous tasks, we can divide the solution into three smaller tasks:\n\nReading the input from the console.\nDoing the calculations.\nPrinting the output on the console.\n\nThe first thing we have to do is go through the input data of the task. It is important to pay attention to the sequence they are given in. We create the necessary variable where we will store the input data and with the methods parseInt(…) and parseFloat(…) we convert the particular string value into an int or double.\n\nAfter we have initialized the variables and have stored the corresponding values in them, we move to the calculations. The code below is blurred on purpose, so the reader can think by himself over it:\n\nWe calculate the values that we have to print on the console. The number of necessary tiles is obtained by dividing the area that needs to be covered by the area of a tile.\nIn the task is specified that the number of the output should be rounded to the second decimal place. That is why we cannot just print the value with console.log(…). We will use the method Math.round(…), which is rounding to the closest integer number. To round it to the second decimal place, we will use the method after the number is multiplied by 100 and then we will divide the result by 100:\n\nTesting in The Judge System\nTest your solution here: https://judge.softuni.org/Contests/Practice/Index/928#2.\nProblem: Money\nSome time ago, Pesho bought Bitcoins. Now, he is going on vacation in Europe and he needs euros. Apart from Bitcoins, he has Chinese yuans as well. Pesho wants to exchange his money for euros for the tour. Write a program that calculates how much euro he can buy, depending on the following exchange rates:\n\n1 Bitcoin = 1168 BGN.\n1 Chinese yuan (CNY) = 0.15 USD.\n1 USD = 1.76 BGN.\n1 EUR = 1.95 BGN.\n\nThe exchange office has a commission fee of 0% to 5% from the final sum in euro.\nInput Data\n3 arguments are passed to the function:\n\nNumber of Bitcoins - integer within the range of  [0 … 20].\nSeveral Chinese yuans - a floating-point number within the range of [0.00 … 50 000.00].\nCommission fee - a floating-point number within the range of [0.00 … 5.00].\n\nOutput Data\nPrint one number on the console – the result of the exchange of currencies. The output should be rounded to the second decimal place.\nSample Input and Output\n\n\n\nInput\nOutput\n\n\n\n\n155\n569.67\n\n\n\nExplanation: \n\n1 Bitcoin = 1168 BGN\n5 Chinese yuan (CNY) = 0.75 USD \n0.75 USD = 1.32 BGN \n1168 + 1.32 = 1169.32 BGN = 599.651282051282 EUR\nCommission fee: 5% of 599.651282051282 = 29.9825641025641 \nResult: 599.651282051282 - 29.9825641025641 = 569.668717948718 EUR\n\n\n\n\nInput\nOutput\nInput\nOutput\n\n\n\n\n2056782.4\n12442.24\n750200.123\n10659.47\n\n\n\nHints and Guidelines\nLet's first think of the way we can solve the task, before having started to write code.\nIdea for Solution\nWe see that the number of bitcoins and the number of Chinese yuans will be given in the input. The output should be in euros. The exchange rates that we have to work with are specified in the task. We notice that we can only exchange the sum in BGN to EUR, therefore, we first have to calculate the whole sum that Pesho has in BGN, and then calculate the output.\nAs we have information for the exchange rate of Bitcoins to BGN, we can directly exchange them. On the other hand, to get the value of Chinese yuans in BGN, first, we have to exchange them in USD, and then the USD to BGN. Finally, we will sum the two values and calculate how much euro that is.\nOnly the final step is left: calculating the commission fee and subtracting the new sum from the total one. We will obtain a floating-point number for the commission fee, which will be a particular percent of the total sum. Let's divide it by 100, to calculate its percentage value. Then we will multiply it by the sum in euro and divide the result from the same sum. Print the final sum on the console.\nChoosing Data Types\nBitcoins are given as an integer, therefore, we can declare a variable converted by the method parseInt(…). For Chinese yuan and commission fee, we obtain a floating-point number, therefore, we are going to use parseFloat(…).\nSolution\nAfter we have built an idea on how to solve the task and we have chosen the data structures that we are going to use, it is time to get to writing the code. As in the previous tasks, we can divide the solution into three smaller tasks:\n\nReading input from the console.\nDoing the calculations.\nPrinting the output on the console.\n\nWe declare the variables that we are going to use and again we have to choose meaningful names, which are going to give us hints about the values they store. We initialize their values: we create variables, where we will store the string arguments passed to the function and convert them to int or double:\n\nWe do the necessary calculations:\n\n\nFinally, we calculate the commission fee and subtract it from the sum in euro. Let's pay attention to the way we could write this: euro -= commission * euro is the short way to write euro = euro - (commission * euro). In this case, we use a combined assignment operator (-=) that subtracts the value of the operand to the right from the one to the left. The operator for multiplication (*) has a higher priority than the combined operator, this is why the expression commission * euro is performed first and then its value is divided.\nFinally, we have to print the result in the console. We should notice that we have to format the output to the second decimal place. The difference between this and the previous task is that here, even if the number is an integer, we have to print it to the second decimal place (for example 5.00). To do so, we can use the method toFixed(…). By using it, we can covert a number into a, saving the specified numbers after the decimal point.   \n\nLet's pay attention to something that applies to all other problems of this type: written like that, the solution of the task is pretty detailed. As the task itself is not too complex, in theory, we could write one big expression, where right after having taken the input, we calculate the output. For example, such an expression would look like this:\n\nThis code would print a correct result, but it is hard to read. It won't be easy to find out how it works and whether it contains any mistakes, as well as finding such and correcting them. Instead of one complex expression, it is better to write a few simpler ones and store their values in variables with appropriate names. This way, the code is cleaner and easily maintainable.\nTesting in The Judge System\nTest your solution here: https://judge.softuni.org/Contests/Practice/Index/928#3.\nProblem: Daily Earnings\nIvan is a programmer in an American company, and he works at home approximately N days per month by earning approximately M USD per day. At the end of the year, Ivan gets a bonus, which equals 2.5 of his monthly salary. In addition, 25% of his annual salary goes for taxes. Write a program that calculates what is the amount of Ivan's net average earnings in BGN per day, as he spends them in Bulgaria. It is accepted that one year has exactly 365 days. The exchange rate of US USD to BGN will be passed to a function.\nInput Data\n3 arguments are passed to the function: \n\nWorkdays per month - an integer within the range of [5 … 30].\nDaily-earnings - A floating-point number within the range of [10.00 … 2000.00].\nExchange rate of USD to EUR /1 USD = X BGN/ - A floating-point number within the range of [0.99 … 1.99].\n\nOutput Data\nPrint one number on the console – the average daily earnings in BGN.

Then, we will choose data types and, finally, we will write the code.\nIdea for Solution\nLet's first calculate how much the monthly salary of Ivan is. We do that by multiplying the working days per month by his daily earnings. We multiply the result by 12, to calculate his salary for 12 months, and then, we multiply it by 2.5, so that we can calculate the bonus. After having summed up the two values, we calculate his annual income. Then, we will reduce the annual income by 25% taxes. Depending on the exchange rate, we exchange the USD to BGN and after that, we divide the result by 365 (days per year).  \nChoosing Data Types\nThe working days per month are given as an integer, therefore, we can declare a variable by using parseInt(…) to store their value as a number. For both the earned money and the exchange rate of USD to BGN, we will obtain a floating-point number, therefore, we will use parseFloat(…). \nSolution\nAgain: after we have an idea of how to solve the problem and we have considered the data types that we are going to use, we can start writing the program. As in the previous tasks, we can divide the solution into three smaller tasks:\n\nReading the input.\nDoing the calculations.\nPrinting the output on the console.\n\nWe declare the variables that we are going to use by trying to choose meaningful names.\nWe create a variable to store the arguments passed to the function, by converting the string to integer or floating number by using parseInt(…)/parseFloat(…): \n\nWe do the calculations:\n\nWe could write an expression that calculates the annual income without brackets as well. As multiplication is an operation that has a higher priority over addition, it will be performed first. Despite that, writing brackets is recommended when using more operators, as this way the code is easily readable, and chances of making a mistake are smaller.\nFinally, we have to print the result on the console. We notice that the number has to be rounded up to the second digit after the decimal point. To do that, we can use .toFixed(…)  just like the previous task:\n\nTesting in The Judge System\nTest your solution here: https://judge.softuni.org/Contests/Practice/Index/928#4.\n"},"chapter-03-simple-conditions.html":{"url":"chapter-03-simple-conditions.html","title":"3.1. Simple Conditions","keywords":"","body":"Chapter 3.1. Simple Conditions\nIn the present chapter, we will take a look at the conditional constructs in the JavaScript programming language. By implementing these constructs, our program can produce a different output based on a given specific input. We will explain the syntax of the conditional operators (if and if-else) by implementing appropriate examples and also we will take a look at the range in which a variable lives (its scope). Finally, we will go over different debugging techniques, to follow the programming steps through which our program goes during its run.\nConditional Operators\nIn programming, we can compare values through the use of the following operators:\n\noperator  (less than)\noperator > (greater than)\noperator  (less than or equals)\noperator >= (greater than or equals)\noperator === (equals)\noperator !== (not equal; different than)\n\nThe result from a comparison is the so-called Boolean value, which can be either true or false depending on the evaluated result being either true or false.\nIt is important to note that in JavaScript there are further comparison operators - for comparison == and difference !=. The implementation of these operators without having intimate knowledge of their evaluation may lead to unexpected results and problems, for the moment we will not take look at them in detail.\nAdditional information on the differences between the two types of comparison operators can be found on the following link: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Comparison_Operators\nProblems of Number Comparisons\n\nProblems of comparing \"text\" (string) type variables\n\nIt is important to note that the case of the letters upper case or lower case is important for the comparison. If the compared values are not completely identical, the output will always be false.\nComparison Operators\nIn JavaScript we can use the following operators to compare data:\n\n\nOperator Notation Applicable for\n\n\nEquals ===  numbers, strings, dates\n\n\nNot equal !== \n\n\nGreater than > numbers, dates, other comparable data types\n\n\nGreater than or equal >= \n\n\nLess than \n\n\nLess than or equal \n\n\n\n\nSimple if Comparisons\nIn programming, we often check particular conditions and perform various actions depending on the result of the comparison. This is done through the if comparison, which has the following structure:\nif (Boolean condition) {\n    // body of the conditional construct;  \n}\n\nProblem: Excellent Result\nWe take the grade as an input argument to our function and upon evaluation, we check if the input value is an excellent grade (≥ 5.50).\n\nTest the example code locally. Try entering different grades, for example, 4.75, 5.49, 5.50, and 6.00. For grades less than 5.50 the program will not give any output, however for grades of 5.50 or greater, the output will be \"Excellent!\". The function is called by simply writing its name and filling the input value in the parenthesis:\n\nTesting in The Judge System\nYou can test the solution example here:\nhttps://judge.softuni.org/Contests/Practice/Index/929#0.\nIf-Else Conditional Constructs\nThe if conditional can also have an else option to provide a specific action to be performed in case the Boolean expression (which is specified at the beginning if (Boolean expression)) returns a negative/falsy result (false). Written in this way the conditional statement is called if-else and its behavior is as follows: if the result of the condition is positive / truthy (true) - a set of instructions is executed. By contrast, when the result is negative / falsy (false) - a different set is executed. The format of this structure in JavaScript is as follows:\nif (Boolean condition) {\n    // Condition body to be executed if a condition is true\n} else {\n    // else structure body to be executed if a condition is false\n}\n\nProblem: Excellent or Not\nSimilarly to the example above, we input a grade and check if it is excellent, but this time we should output a result in both cases:\n\nTesting in Judge System\nYou can test your solution at the following link: https://judge.softuni.org/Contests/Practice/Index/929#1.\nAbout The Curly Braces { } After an If / Else\nWhen we have only one command in the body of the if statement, we can skip the curly braces, indicating the body of the conditional operator. When we need to execute a block of code (group of commands), curly braces are mandatory. In case the braces are omitted, only the first line of code will be executed after the if statement.\n\nIt is a good practice to  always include curly braces since this makes the code more readable, neater, and cleaner.\n\n\nHere is an example, where omitting the curly braces leads to confusion:\n\nExecuting the code above will produce the following console output:\n\nWith curly braces:\n\nThe following output will be printed on the console:\n\nProblem: Even or Odd\nWrite a function that checks whether a given input number is even or odd.\nThe problem can be solved with a single if-else structure and the operator %, which returns the division remainder of two numbers.\n\nTesting in The Judge System\nTest your solution here: https://judge.softuni.org/Contests/Practice/Index/929#2.\nProblem: Greater Number\nWrite a program that reads two integers and outputs the greater one.\nOur first task is to read the two numbers.

This scope specifies where the variable can be used and accessed. In JavaScript, there are two ways to initialize variables. This is done through the keyword var or let. It is important to note the difference between them, as to avoid unexpected and unwanted results during the design and execution of our functions.\nVariables initialized with the keyword var have the properties of global variables. They are characterized by the fact that they can be accessed anywhere, regardless of the location in our code, where they are declared.\nUsing the keyword let, our variable assumes the properties of a local variable. This means that its lifetime begins at the row in which it is defined and ends until the first closing curly brace } (of the function, of the if statement, etc.). Owing to this it is important to know that every variable initialized with the keyword let within the body of an if, will not be accessible outside its code block / scope, unless we have defined it higher in the code.\nIn the example below, in the last lines, we will try to access the defined variables. We will print myMoney on the console, because it is declared at the beginning of our function, before the if structure, which makes it available anywhere in the function body. Even though the salary is declared in the if structure block, we can print it because it has the properties of a global variable (since it is declared with var) and can be used anywhere. When we try to print the bonus variable, which is initialized in the if structure, we will get an error, since the lifetime of this variable ends with the first closing curly brace }, which in this case is the one closing the if structure:\n\nUsing the keyword var was the only way in the past to declare a variable, nowadays however this is not recommended. Because of this in all examples in this book, we will use the keyword let.\nIt is important to note that there is a third way to initialize variables - through the use of the keyword const. These variables have the same scope as if defined through let, however have one key difference - they are constant variables. This means that after the initial assignment, their value is impossible to be changed or the variable re-defined.\nConditional Chaining\nSometimes we have to do a series of checks, before deciding what actions our program will execute. In such cases we can apply the structure if-else if…-else in series. For this purpose we employ the following structure: \nif (first condition) {\n    // condition body;\n} else if (second condition) {\n    // condition body;\n} else if (third condition) {\n    // condition body;\n}\n…\nelse {\n    // else structure body;\n}\n\nProblem: Number 0...9 to Text\nPrint the digits one through nine in English on the console (the numbers are passed as arguments of the function upon call). We can take the digit and through a series of conditions print the corresponding English word on the console:\nfunction number1to9([arg1]) {\n  let num = parseInt(arg1);\n\n  if (num === 1) {\n      console.log(\"one\");\n  } else if (num === 2) {\n      console.log(\"two\");\n  } else if (num === 3) {\n      console.log(\"three\");\n  }\n  // TODO: add more checks\n  else {\n      console.log(\"number too big\"); \n  }\n}\n\nThe program logic of the above example sequentially compares the input number with the digits from 1 to 9 with each consecutive comparison being performed only in case the previous result is not true. Eventually, if none of the if conditionals are satisfied, the last else clause is executed.\nTesting in The Judge System\nTest your solution here: https://judge.softuni.org/Contests/Practice/Index/929#4.\nExercise: Simple Conditions\nTo practice the implementation of the conditional constructs if and if-else, we will take a look at a few practical problems.\nProblem: Bonus Score\nWe are given an integer – several points.

As we can see from the conversion table above, we have data for converting only between meters and any other measuring unit. To make the conversion, firstly we must calculate the input measurement in meters. To this effect, we need to create a set of conditionals to determine the input measuring unit and then the output.\n\nTesting in The Judge System\nTest your solution here: https://judge.softuni.org/Contests/Practice/Index/929#7.\nDebugging - Simple Operations With a Debugger\nTo date, we have written quite a lot of code and oftentimes there were mistakes, were there? Now we can show you a tool to make finding mistakes easier.\nWhat is \"Debugging\"?\nDebugging is the process of „attaching“ to a program's execution, which allows us to follow closely the execution of our program. We can follow line by line the events in our program, what is its evaluation route, what are the intermediate values of the declared variables at each step of the execution, among other useful information and thus allowing us to locate errors - the so-called bugs.\n\nDebugging in Visual Studio Code\nWe add a point, at which our function will stop its execution - a breakpoint after which we start the program in debug mode through pressing [F5]. The program will follow its course until it reaches our interrupt (breakpoint). After which we the execution can proceed to the next line of code by pressing [F10]. \nProblem: Password Guess\nWrite a function that accepts a password (one line of random text) and checks if the input matches the phrase “s3cr3t!P@ssw0rd”.

We will employ the knowledge from this chapter to select from the different available currencies and make calculations as per the appropriate exchange rates for the given currency.\nProblem: ** Currency Converter\nNow let's see how to create a graphical (GUI) application for currency conversion. The application will look similar to the picture below:  \n\nFor visualization, we will use an internet browser, that interprets HTML pages. We will create a new page and will build the structure, appearance, and functionality of our application.\nAs usual, we create a new file, save it with the name Currency-Converter, however this time we add the file extension .html.\n\nWe open the newly created file and input the document structure, as HTML code:\n\n\n\n  \n  \n  \n  Currency Converter\n  \n\n        /* enter styling here */\n\n  \n\n\n  \n    Currency Converter\n    \n      \n      BGN &#8594; \n      \n        Select currency\n        EUR\n        USD\n        GBP\n      \n      \n      \n    \n  \n  \n\n    // enter JavaScript functionality here\n\n  \n\n\n\nWe save the file and open it in the internet browser.\n\nAt this point we already have the document skeleton, but it can be visually enhanced through the addition of styling. To do this we add the following code in the  section for our HTML document:\nbody {\n  background-color: #fff;\n}\n\nmain {\n  margin: 200px auto;\n  height: 250px;\n  width: 500px;\n  background-color: #e7e7e7;\n  border: 1px solid black;\n  border-radius: 20px;\n  box-shadow: 3px 3px 3px gray;\n}\n\nh1 {\n  text-align: center;\n  color: #000;\n  text-shadow: 1px 1px 1px #000;\n}\n\nform {\n  width: 400px;\n  margin:20px auto;\n  text-align: center;\n}\n\nspan {\n  font-weight:bold;\n  font-size: 16px;\n}\n\ninput[type=number], input[type=text], select {\n    width: 140px;\n    padding: 8px 10px;\n    margin: 20px 0;\n    display: inline-block;\n    border: 1px solid #ccc;\n    border-radius: 10px;\n    box-sizing: border-box;\n    outline: none;\n    text-align: center\n}\n input[type=text] {\n   width: 80%;\n   margin-top:20px;\n   background-color: #7beb80;\n   padding: 12px 10px;\n   color:black;\n   font-weight: bold;\n   font-size: 15px;\n }\n\n input:focus {\n   border: 2px solid #26a5e0;\n }\n\nNow if we save and hit refresh, our application should look much better. All that is left now is to add the functionality. This is done through the  section of our HTML document.\nWe will use the following JavaScript code to handle different user inputs and events:\nfunction convert(){\n  let x = document.getElementById(\"cash-input\").value;\n  let e = document.getElementById(\"currency-options\");\n  let selected = e.options[e.selectedIndex].text;\n  let result;\n\n  if (selected === \"EUR\") {\n      result = x + \" \" + \"BGN = \" + (x * 1.95583).toFixed(2) + \" \" + selected;\n      document.getElementById(\"result\").value = result;\n  } else if (selected === \"USD\") {\n      result = x + \" \" + \"BGN = \" + (x * 1.63760).toFixed(2)  + \" \" + selected;\n      document.getElementById(\"result\").value = result;\n  } else if (selected === \"GBP\") {\n      result = x + \" \" + \"BGN = \" + (x * 2.22920).toFixed(2)  + \" \" + selected;\n      document.getElementById(\"result\").value = result;\n  }\n}\n\nThe above code takes the amount to be converted from the field cash-input and the chosen currency for the result of the field currency-options. After that with the use of a conditional statement, depending on the chosen currency, the amount is divided by the exchange rate (which is hard-coded by you in the source code). Finally, we generate a text message with the result (rounded to the second digit after the decimal point) and we output the message in the green box result. Have a go!\nIf you have problems with the examples above, watch the video at the beginning of this chapter or ask for help in the SoftUni official Reddit: https://www.reddit.com/r/softuni/.\n"},"chapter-03-simple-conditions-exam-problems.html":{"url":"chapter-03-simple-conditions-exam-problems.html","title":"3.2. Simple Conditions – Exam Problems","keywords":"","body":"Chapter 3.2. Simple Conditions – Exam Problems\nIn the previous chapter, we went through the simple conditional statements in JavaScript, which we can use to execute different actions depending on a given condition. We mentioned what is the scope of a variable (it's scope) and how to track the execution of our program step by step (the so-called debugging). In this chapter, working with simple conditions by going through some exam tasks. To do this, let's first revise their construction:\nif (bool expression) {\n    // condition body;\n} else {\n    // else-construction body;\n}\n\nif conditions consist of:\n\nif clause\nbool expression - a variable of bool type (Boolean) or bool logical expression (an expression that results in true/false)\ncondition body - contains a random block of source code\nelse clause and its block of source code (optional)\n\nExam Problems\nAfter having revised how to write simple conditions, let's solve a few exam problems to practice the if-else construction:\nProblem: Transport Price\nA student has to travel n kilometers. He can choose between three types of transportation: \n\nTaxi. Starting fee: 0.70 BGN. Day rate: 0.79 BGN/km. Night rate: 0.90 BGN/km.\nBus. Day / Night rate: 0.09 BGN/km. Can be used for distances of a minimum of 20 km.\nTrain. Day / Night rate: 0.06 BGN/km. Can be used for distances of a minimum of 100 km.\n\nWrite a program that reads the number of kilometers n and period of the day (day or night) and calculates the price for the cheapest transport.\nInput Data\nTwo lines (arguments) are read from the console:\n\nThe first line (arguments) contains a number n – number of kilometers – an integer in the range of [1 … 5000].\nThe second line contains the word \"day\" or \"night\" – traveling during the day or the night.\n\nOutput Data\nPrint on the console the lowest price for the given number of kilometers.\nSample Input and Output\n\n\n\nInput\nOutput\nInput\nOutput\n\n\n\n\n5day\n4.65\n7night\n7\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInput\nOutput\nInput\nOutput\n\n\n\n\n25day\n2.25\n180night\n10.8\n\n\n\nHints and Guidelines\nWe will read the input data and depending on the distance, we will choose the cheapest transport. To do that, we will write a few conditional statements.\nProcessing The Input Data\nIn the task, we are given information about the input and output data. Therefore, the first part of the task is to declare and initialize two variables where we will store the values of the input data:\n\nBefore starting with the conditional statements, we need to declare one more variable that stores the value of the transport price:\n\nChecking The Conditions and Calculating\nAfter having declared and initialized the input data and the variable that stores the value of the price, we have to decide which conditions of the task have to be checked first. \nThe task specifies that the rates of two of the vehicles do not depend on whether it is day or night, but the rate of one of the transports (taxi) depends. This is why the first condition will be whether it is day or night so that it is clear which rate the taxi will be using. To do that, we declare one more variable that stores the value of the taxi rate:\n\nTo calculate the taxi rate, we will use a conditional statement of type if-else:\n\nAfter having done that, now we can start calculating the transport price itself. The constraints in the task refer to the distance that the student wants to travel. This is why, we will use an if-else statement that will help us find the price of the transport, depending on the given kilometers:\n\nFirst, we check whether the kilometers are less than 20, as the task specifies that the student can only use a taxi for less than 20 kilometers. If the condition is true (returns true), the variable that is created to store the value of the transport (price), will store the corresponding value. This value equals the starting fee that we will sum with its rate, multiplied by the distance that the student has to travel.\nIf the condition of the variable is not true (returns false), the next step of our program is to check whether the kilometers are less than 100. We do that because the task specifies that in this range, a bus can be used as well. The price per kilometer of a bus is cheaper than a taxi one. Therefore, if the result of the condition is true, we store a value, equal to the result of the multiplication of the rate of the bus by the distance to the variable for the transportation price in the else if statement body.\nIf this condition does not return true as a result, we have to store a value, equal to the result of the multiplication of the distance by the train rate to the price variable in the else body. This is done because the train is the cheapest transport for the given distance. \nPrinting The Output\nAfter we have checked the distance conditions and we have calculated the price of the cheapest transport, we have to print it. The task does not specify how to format the result, therefore, we just print the variable:\n\nTesting in The Judge System\nTest your solution here: https://judge.softuni.org/Contests/Practice/Index/930#0.\nProblem: Pipes In Pool\nA pool with volume V fills up via two pipes. Each pipe has a certain flow rate (the liters of water, flowing through a pipe for an hour). A worker starts the pipes simultaneously and goes out for N hours. Write a program that finds the state of the pool the moment the worker comes back. \nInput Data\nFour numbers are passed to the function (arguments):\n\nThe first line (argument) contains a number V – the volume of the pool in liters – an integer in the range of [1 … 10000].\nThe second line (argument) contains a number P1 – the flow rate of the first pipe per hour – an integer in the range of [1 … 5000].\nThe third line (argument) contains a number P2 – the flow rate of the second pipe per hour – an integer in the range of [1 … 5000].\nThe fourth line (argument) contains a number H – the hours that the worker is absent – a floating-point number in the range of [1.0 … 24.00].\n\nOutput Data\nPrint on the console one of the two possible states:\n\nTo what extent the pool has filled up and how many percent each pipe has contributed. All percent values must be formatted to an integer (without rounding).\n\n\"The pool is [x]% full. Pipe 1: [y]%. Pipe 2: [z]%.\"\n\n\nIf the pool has overflown – with how many liters it has overflown for the given time – a floating-point number. \n\"For [x] hours the pool overflows with [y] liters.\"\n\n\n\nHave in mind that due to the rounding to an integer, there is data loss and it is normal for the sum of the percents to be 99%, not 100%. \nSample Input and Output\n\n\n\nInput\nOutput\nInput\nOutput\n\n\n\n\n10001001203\nThe pool is 66% full. Pipe 1: 45%. Pipe 2: 54%.\n1001001002.5\nFor 2.5 hours the pool overflows with 400 liters.\n\n\n\nHints and Guidelines\nTo solve the task, we read the input data, write a few conditional statements, do some calculations and print the result.\nProcessing The Input Data\nOur first step is to read the input data:\n\nOur next step is to declare and initialize a variable in which we are going to calculate how many liters the pool has filled up for the time the worker was absent. We do the calculations by summing the values of the flow rates of the two pipes and multiplying them by the hours that are given as input data:\n\nChecking The Conditions and Processing Output Data\nAfter we have the value of the quantity of water that has flown through the pipes, the next step is to compare that quantity with the volume of the pool itself.\nWe do that with a simple if-else statement, where the condition will be whether the quantity of water is less than the volume of the pool. If the statement returns true, we have to print one line that contains the ratio between the quantity of water that has flown through the pipes and the volume of the pool, as well as the ratio of the quantity of the water from each pipe to the volume of the pool. \nThe ratio has to be in percentage, that is why all the calculations so far will be multiplied by 100. The values will be printed using placeholders, and as there is a condition for the result in percentage to be formatted to two digits after the decimal point without rounding, we will use the method Math.trunc(…):\n\nHowever, if the condition returns false, that means that the quantity of water is more than the volume of the pool, therefore, it has overflown. Again, the output data has to be on one line, but this time it should contain only two values – one of the hours when the worker was absent, and the quantity of water, which is the difference between *the incoming water and the volume of the pool.\nTesting in The Judge System\nTest your solution here: https://judge.softuni.org/Contests/Practice/Index/930#1.\nProblem: Sleepy Tom Cat\nTom Cat likes to sleep all day but, unfortunately, his owner is always playing with him whenever he has free time. To sleep well, the norm of games that Tom has is 30 000 minutes per year. The time for games he has depends on the holidays that his owner has:\n\nDuring workdays, his owner plays with him 63 minutes per day. \nDuring holidays, his owner plays with him 127 minutes per day. \n\nWrite a program that reads the number of holidays and prints whether Tom can sleep well and how much the difference from the norm for the current year is. It is assumed that there are 365 days in one year. \nExample: 20 holidays -> the working days are 345 (365 - 20 = 345). The time for games is 24 275 minutes (345 * 63 + 20 * 127). The difference from the norm is 5 725 minutes (30 000 – 24 275 = 5 725) or 95 hours and 25 minutes.\nInput Data\nThe input is read from the console and consists of an integer – the number of holidays in the range of [0 … 365].\nOutput Data\nTwo lines have to be printed on the console: \n\nIf Tom's time for games is above the norm for the current year: \nOn the first line print: “Tom will run away”.\nOn the second line print the difference from the norm in the format:“{H} hours and {M} minutes more for play”.\n\n\nIf the time for games of Tom is below the norm for the current year:\nOn the first line print: “Tom sleeps well”.\nOn the second line print the difference from the norm in the format:“{H} hours and {M} minutes less for play”.\n\n\n\nSample Input and Output\n\n\n\nInput\nOutput\nInput\nOutput\n\n\n\n\n20\nTom sleeps well95 hours and 25 minutes less for play\n113\nTom will run away3 hours and 47 minutes more for play\n\n\n\nHints and Guidelines\nTo solve the problem, we will read the input data. Then, we will write a few conditional statements and do some calculations. Finally, we will print the result.\nReading The Input Data and Calculating\nFrom the task, we see that the input data will be an integer in the range of [0 … 365].\n\nTo solve the problem, first, we have to calculate the total minutes the owner of Tom is playing with him. We see that not only does the sleepy cat has to play with his owner during the holidays, but also during the working days. The number that we read from the console refers to the holidays. \nOut next step is to calculate, with the help of that number, how many the working days of the owner are, as without them we cannot calculate the total minutes for play. As the total number of days per year is 365 and the number of holidays is X, that means that the number of working days is 365 - X*. We store the difference in a new variable that only stores this value:\n\nOnce we have the number of days for playing, we can calculate the time for games of Tom in minutes. Its value is equal to the result of the multiplication of the working days by 63 minutes (the task specifies that during working days, the time for play is 63 minutes per day), summed with the result of the multiplication of the holidays by 127 minutes (the task specifies that during holidays, the time for play is 127 minutes per day).\n\nIn the task condition, we see that we have to print the difference between the two values in hours and minutes as output data. That is why we subtract the total time for play from the norm of 30 000 minutes and store the result in a new variable. After that, we divide that variable by 60 to get the hours, and then, to find out how many the minutes are, we use modular division with the operator %, as again we divide the variable of the difference by 60.\nHere we have to note that if the total time for the playing of Tom is less than 30,000 when subtracting the norm from it, we will obtain a negative number. To neutralize the number in the division, we use the method Math.abs(…) when finding the difference:\n\nChecking The Conditions\nThe time for games is already calculated, which leads us to the next step – comparing the time for play of Tom with the norm on which the good sleep of the cat depends. To do so, we will use an if-else conditional statement. In the if clause we will check whether the time for play is more than 30 000 (the norm).\nProcessing the Output Data\nWhatever the result of the conditional statement is, we have to print how much the difference in hours and minutes is. We will do that with a placeholder and the variables that store the values of the hours and the minutes, as the formatting will be according to the task requirements for output.\n\nTesting in The Judge System\nTest your solution here: https://judge.softuni.org/Contests/Practice/Index/930#2.\nProblem: Harvest\nIn a vineyard with an area of X square meters, 40% of the harvest goes for wine production. Y kilograms of grapes are extracted from a 1 square meters vineyard. 2,5 kg of grapes is needed for 1 liter of wine. The wanted quantity of wine for sale is Z liters.\nWrite a program that calculates how much wine can be produced and whether that quantity is enough. If it is enough, the rest is divided between the vineyard workers equally.\nInput Data\nThe input data consists of exactly 4 lines (arguments): \n\nFirst line (argument): X square meters is the vineyard size – an integer in the range of [10 … 5000].\nSecond line (argument): Y grapes for one square meters – an integer in the range of [0.00 … 10.00].\nThird line (argument): Z needed liters of wine – an integer in the range of [10 … 600].\nFourth line (argument): number of workers – an integer in the range of [1 … 20].\n\nOutput Data\nThe following has to be printed on the console:\n\nIf the produced wine is less than the needed quantity:\n“It will be a tough winter! More {insufficient wine} liters wine needed.”* The result has to be rounded down to the nearest integer.\n\n\nIf the produced wine is more than the needed quantity:\n“Good harvest this year! Total wine: {total wine} liters.”* The result has to be rounded down to the nearest integer.\n“{Wine left} liters left -> {wine for one worker} liters per person.”* Both of the results have to be rounded up to the higher integer.\n\n\n\nSample Input and Output\n\n\n\nInput\nOutput\nInput\nOutput\n\n\n\n\n65021753\nGood harvest this year! Total wine: 208 liters.33 liters left -> 11 liters per person.\n10201.54254\nIt will be a tough winter! More 180 liters wine needed.\n\n\n\nHints and Guidelines\nTo solve the problem, we will read the input data. Then, we will write a few conditional statements and do some calculations. Finally, we will print the result.\nProcessing The Input Data and Performing The Calculations\nFirst, we have to read the input data: \n\nTo solve the problem, based on the input data, we have to calculate how many liters of wine will be produced. From the task requirements, we see that to calculate the quantity of wine in liters, we first, have to find the number of grapes in kilograms, which we will get from the harvest. For that, we will declare a variable that keeps a value, equal to 40% of the result from the multiplication of the vineyard area by the number of grapes, which is extracted from 1 m2m^2m​2​​.\nAfter having done these calculations, we are ready to calculate the quantity of wine in liters that will be produced from the harvest as well. For that, we declare one more variable that stores that quantity. To calculate, we have to divide the number of grapes in kg by 2.5:\n\nChecking The Conditions and Processing Output Data\nAfter having done the necessary calculations, the next step is to check whether the liters of wine that have been produced, are enough. For that, we will use a simple conditional statement of the if-else type and we will check whether the liters of wine from the harvest are more than or equal to the needed liters. \nIf the condition returns true, from the task requirement we see that on the first line we have to print the wine that has been produced from the harvest. That value has to be rounded down to the nearest integer, which we will do by using both the method Math.floor(…) and a placeholder when printing it.\nOn the second line, we have to print the results by rounding them up to the higher integer, which we will do by using the method Math.ceil(…). The values that we have to print are the quantity of wine left and the quantity that each worker gets. The wine left is equal to the difference between the produced liters of wine and the needed liters of wine. \nWe calculate the value of that quantity in a new variable, which we declare and initialize in the if condition body, before printing the first line. We calculate the quantity of wine that each worker gets by dividing the wine left by the number of workers.\n\nIf the condition returns false, we have to print the difference between the needed liters and the liters of wine produced from the harvest. There is a specification that the result has to be rounded down to the nearest integer, which we will do by using the method Math.floor(…).\n\nTesting in The Judge System\nTest your solution here: https://judge.softuni.org/Contests/Practice/Index/930#3.\nProblem: Firm\nA firm gets a request for creating a project for which a certain number of hours are needed. The firm has a certain number of days. During 10% of the days, the workers are being trained and cannot work on the project. A normal working day is 8 hours long. The project is important for the firm and every worker must work on it with overtime of 2 hours per day. \nThe hours must be rounded down to the nearest integer (for example, 6.98 hours are rounded to 6 hours).\nWrite a program that calculates whether the firm can finish the project on time and how many hours more are needed or left.\nInput Data\nThe input data contains exactly three lines (arguments): \n\nOn the first line (argument) are the needed hours – an integer in the range of [0 … 200 000].\nOn the second line (argument) are the days that the firm has – an integer in the range of [0 … 20 000].\nOn the third line (argument) are the number of all workers – an integer in the range of [0 … 200].\n\nOutput Data\nPrint one line on the console: \n\nIf the time is enough:\n\"Yes!{the hours left} hours left.\"\n\n\nIf  the time is NOT enough:\n\"Not enough time!{additional hours} hours needed.\"\n\n\n\nSample Input and Output\n\n\n\nInput\nOutput\nInput\nOutput\n\n\n\n\n9073\nYes!99 hours left.\n9931\nNot enough time!72 hours needed.\n\n\n\nHints and Guidelines\nTo solve the problem, we will read the input data. Then, we will write a few conditional statements and do some calculations. Finally, we will print the result.\nReading The Input Data\nFirst, we have to read the input data to solve the problem.\n\nAuxiliary Calculations\nThe next step is to calculate the number of total working hours by multiplying the working days by 8 (every working day is 8 hours long) with the number of workers and then sum them with the overtime. The working days equal 90% of the days that the firm has. The overtime equals the result of the multiplication of the number of workers by 2 (the possible hours of overtime) and then it is multiplied by the number of days that the firm has. From the task requirements, we see that the hours should be rounded down to the nearest integer, which we will do with the method Math.floor(…).\n\nChecking The Conditions\nAfter having done the calculations that are needed to find the value of the working hours, now we have to check whether these hours are enough,  or some hours are left.\nIf the time is enough, we print the result that is specified in the task requirements, which in this case is the difference between the working hours and the hours needed for finishing the project. \nIf the time is not enough, we print the additional hours that are needed for finishing the project. They equal the difference between the hours for the project and the total working hours.\n\nTesting in The Judge System\nTest your solution here: https://judge.softuni.org/Contests/Practice/Index/930#4.\n"},"chapter-04-complex-conditions.html":{"url":"chapter-04-complex-conditions.html","title":"4.1. More Complex Conditions","keywords":"","body":"Chapter 4.1. More Complex Conditions\nIn this current chapter, we are going to examine nested conditional statements in the JavaScript language, by which our program can execute conditions, that contain other nested conditional statements. We call them \"nested\" because we put the if condition into another if condition. We are going to examine the more complex logical conditions through proper examples.\nNested Conditions\nPretty often the program logic requires the use of if or if-else statements, which are contained one inside another. They are called nested if or if-else statements. As implied by the title \"nested\",these are if or if-else statements, that are placed inside other if or  else statements.\nif (condition1) {\n    if (condition2) {\n        // body; \n    } else {\n        // body;\n    }\n}\n\nUsing more than three levels of nested conditional statements is not considered a good practice and has to be avoided, mostly through optimization of the structure/the algorithm of the code and/or by using another type of conditional statement, which we are going to examine below in this chapter.\nProblem: Personal Titles\nDepending on age (decimal number) and gender (m / f) print a personal title:\n\n“Mr.” – man (gender “m”) 16 or more years old.\n“Master” – boy (gender “m”) under 16 years.\n“Ms.” – woman (gender “f”) 16 or more years old.\n“Miss” – girl (gender “f”) under 16 years.\n\nSample Input and Output\n\n\n\nInput\nOutput\nInput\nOutput\n\n\n\n\n12f\nMiss\n17m\nMr.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInput\nOutput\nInput\nOutput\n\n\n\n\n25f\nMs.\n13.5m\nMaster\n\n\n\nSolution\nWe should notice that the output of the program depends on a few things. First, we have to check what gender entered and then to check the age. Respectively, we are going to use a few if-else blocks. These blocks will be nested, i.e. from the result of the first, we are going to define which of the others to execute.\n\nAfter reading the input data from the console, the following program logic should be executed:\n\nTesting in The Judge System\nTest your solution here: https://judge.softuni.org/Contests/Practice/Index/931#0.\nProblem: Small Shop\nA Bulgarian entrepreneur opens small shops in a few cities with different prices for the following products:\n\n\n\nproduct / city\nSofia\nPlovdiv\nVarna\n\n\n\n\ncoffeewaterbeersweetspeanuts\n0.500.801.201.451.60\n0.400.701.151.301.50\n0.450.701.101.351.55\n\n\n\nCalculate the price by the given city (string), product (string), and quantity (decimal number).\nSample Input and Output\n\n\n\nInput\nOutput\nInput\nOutput\n\n\n\n\ncoffeeVarna2\n0.90\npeanutsPlovdiv1\n1.50\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInput\nOutput\nInput\nOutput\n\n\n\n\nbeerSofia6\n7.20\nwaterPlovdiv3\n2.10\n\n\n\nSolution\nWe convert all of the letters into the lower register by using the method .toLowerCase(), to compare products and cities no matter what the letters are - small/capital ones.\n\nTesting in The Judge System\nTest your solution here: https://judge.softuni.org/Contests/Practice/Index/931#1.\nMore Complex Conditions\nLet's take a look at how we can create more complex conditions. We can use the logical \"AND\" (&&), logical \"OR\" (||), logical negation (!) or brackets (()).\nLogical \"AND\"\nAs we saw, in some tasks we have to make multiple checks at once. But what happens, when executing some code,  more conditions have to be executed and we don't want to make a negation (else) for each one of them? The option with the nested if blocks are valid, but the code will look very unordered and for sure - hard to read and maintain.  \nLogical \"AND\" (operator &&) means a few conditions have to be fulfilled simultaneously. The following table of truthfulness is applicable:\n\n\n\na\nb\na && b\n\n\n\n\ntruetruefalsefalse\ntruefalsetruefalse\ntruefalsefalsefalse\n\n\n\nHow Does The && Operator Work?\nThe operator && accepts a couple of Boolean (conditional) statements, which have a true or false value, and returns one boolean statement as a result. Using it instead of a couple of nested if blocks, makes the code more readable, ordered, and easy to maintain. But how does it work, when we put a few conditions one after another? As we saw above, the logical \"AND\" returns true, only when it accepts as arguments statements with the value true. Respectively, when we have a sequence of arguments, the logical \"AND\" checks either until one of the arguments is over, or until it meets an argument with value false. \nExample:\nlet a = true;\nlet b = true;\nlet c = false;\nlet d = true;\n\nlet result = a && b && c && d;\n// false (as d is not being checked)\n\nThe program will run in the following way: It starts the check from a, reads it, and accepts that it has a true value, after that, it  checks b. After it has accepted, that a and b return value true, it checks the next argument. It gets to c and sees that the variable has a false value. After the program accepts that argument c has a false value, it calculates the expression to c, regardless of what the value of d is. That is why the evaluation of dis being skipped and the whole expression is calculated as false.\nProblem: Point in Rectangle\nChecks whether point {x, y} is placed inside the rectangle {x1, y1} – {x2, y2}. The input data is readfrom the console and consists of 6 lines: the decimal numbers x1, y1, x2, y2, x, and y (as it is guaranteed that x1  and y1 ).\nSample Input and Output\n\n\n\nInput\nOutput\nVisualization\n\n\n\n\n2-31238-1\nInside\n\n\n\n\nSolution\nA point is internal for a given polygon if the following four conditions are applied at the same time:\n\nThe point is placed to the right from the left side of the rectangle.\nThe point is placed to the left from the right side of the rectangle.\nThe point is placed downwards from the upper side of the rectangle.\nThe point is placed upwards from the downside of the rectangle.\n\n\nTesting in The Judge System\nTest your solution here: https://judge.softuni.org/Contests/Practice/Index/931#2.\nLogical \"OR\"\nThe logical \"OR\" (operator ||) means that at least one among a few conditions is fulfilled. Similar to the operator &&, the logical \"OR\" accepts a few arguments of boolean (conditional) type and returns true or false. We can easily guess that we obtain as value true, whenever at least one of the arguments has a true value. A typical example of the logic of this operator is the following:\nAt school, the teacher says: \"Ivan or Peter should clean the board\". To fulfill this condition (to clean the board), either Ivan can clean it, or just for Peter to clean it, or both of them to clean it together.\n\n\n\na\nb\na || b\n\n\n\n\ntruetruefalsefalse\ntruefalsetruefalse\ntruetruetruefalse\n\n\n\nHow Does The || Operator Work?\nWe have already learned what the logical \"OR\" represents. But how is it being achieved? Just like the logical \"AND\", the program checks from left to right the arguments, that are given. To obtain true from the expression, just one argument must have a true value, respectively the checking continues until an argument with such value is met or until the arguments are over.\nHere is one example of the operator || in action:\nlet a = false;\nlet b = true;\nlet c = false;\nlet d = true;\n\nlet result = a || b || c || d;\n// true (as c and d are not being checked)\n\nThe program checks a, accepts that it has a value false, and continues. Reaching b, it understands that it has true value and the whole expression is calculated as true, without having to check c or d, because their values wouldn't change the result of the expression.\nProblem: Fruit or Vegetable\nLet's check whether a given product is a fruit or a vegetable. The \"fruits\" are banana, apple, kiwi, cherry, lemon, and grapes. The \"vegetables\" are tomato, cucumber, pepper, and carrot. Everything else is \"unknown\".\nSample Input and Output\n\n\n\nInput\nOutput\n\n\n\n\nbananatomatoJava\nfruitvegetableunknown\n\n\n\nSolution\nWe have to use a few conditional statements with logical \"OR\" (||):\n\nTesting in The Judge System\nTest your solution here: https://judge.softuni.org/Contests/Practice/Index/931#3.\nLogical Negation\nLogical negation (operator !) means a given condition is not fulfilled.\n\n\n\na\n!a\n\n\n\n\ntrue\nfalse\n\n\n\nThe operator ! accepts as an argument a boolean variable and returns its value.\nProblem: Invalid Number\nA given number is valid if it is in the range [100 … 200] or it is 0.

The operator () serves to change the priority of the operator and is calculated first, just like in math. The use of parentheses also gives the code better readability and is considered a good practice.\nMore Complex Logical Conditions\nSometimes the conditions may be very complex, so they can require a long boolean expression or a sequence of conditions. Let's take a look at a few problems.\nProblem: Point on Rectangle Border\nWrite a program that checks whether a point {x, y} is placed onto any of the sides of a rectangle {x1, y1} - {x2, y2}. The input data is read from the console and consists of 6 lines: the decimal numbers x1, y1, x2, y2, x, and y (as it is guaranteed that x1  and y1 ). Print \"Border\" (if the point lies on any of the sides) or \"Inside / Outside\" (in the opposite case).\n\nSample Input and Output\n\n\n\nInput\nOutput\nInput\nOutput\n\n\n\n\n2-312312-1\nBorder\n2-31238-1\nInside / Outside\n\n\n\nSolution\nThe point lies on any of the sides of the rectangle, if:\n\nx coincides with x1 or x2 and at the same time y is between y1 and y2 or\ny coincides with y1 or y2 and at the same time x is between x1 and x2.\n\n\nThe previous evaluation might be simplified in the following way:\n\nThe second way with the additional boolean variables is longer, but is much more understandable than the first one, isn't it? We recommend when you write boolean conditions to make them easy to read and understand, instead of making them short. Use additional variables with meaningful names, if needed. The names of the boolean variables have to hint at what the value that is kept inside them represents.\nWhat remains is to finish writing the code to print “Inside / Outside”, if the point is not onto any of the sides of the rectangle.\nTesting in The Judge System\nAfter you finish writing the solution, you can test it here: https://judge.softuni.org/Contests/Practice/Index/931#5.\nProblem: Fruit Shop\nA fruit shop during weekdays sells at the following prices:\n\n\n\nFruit\nPrice\n\n\n\n\nbananaappleorangegrapefruitkiwipineapplegrapes\n2.501.200.851.452.705.503.85\n\n\n\nDuring the weekend days the prices are higher:\n\n\n\nFruit\nPrice\n\n\n\n\nbananaappleorangegrapefruitkiwipineapplegrapes\n2.701.250.901.603.005.604.20\n\n\n\nWrite a program that reads from the console fruit (banana / apple / …), a day of the week (Monday / Tuesday / …), and quantity (decimal number) and calculates the price according to the prices from the tables above.

Initially, we set the commission fee to -1. It will be changed if the city and the price range are found in the table of commissions. To calculate the commission according to the city and volume of sales, we need a few nested if statements, as in the sample code below:\n\nTesting in The Judge System\nTest your solution here: https://judge.softuni.org/Contests/Practice/Index/931#7.\n\nIt is a good practice to use blocks, that are enclosed with curly braces { } after if and else. Also, it is recommended during writing to move aside the code after if and else with a single tabulation inward, to make the code more easily readable.\n\n\n\nSwitch-Case Conditional Statements\nThe switch-case  construction works as a sequence of if-else blocks. Whenever the work of our program depends on the value of one variable, instead of making consecutive with if-else blocks, we can use the conditional switch-case statement. It is being used for choosing between a list of possibilities. The statement compares a given value with defined constants and depending on the result, it takes an action.\nWe put the variable, that we want to compare, inside the brackets after the operator switch and it is called a \"selector\". Here the type must be comparable (numbers, strings). Consecutively, the program starts comparing each value, that is found after the case labels. Upon a match, the executions of the code from the respective place continue, until it reaches the break operator. When no matches are found, the default construction is being executed, if such exist.\nswitch (selector) {\n    case value1:\n        construction;\n        break;\n    case value2:\n        construction;\n        break;\n    case value3:\n        construction;\n        break;\n    …\n    default:\n        construction;\n        break;\n}\n\nProblem: Day of Week\nLet's write a program that prints the day of the week (in English) depending on the given number (1 … 7) or \"Error\" if an invalid day is given.\nSample Input and Output\n\n\n\nInput\nOutput\n\n\n\n\n17-1\nMondaySundayError\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\nIt is a good practice to put at first place those case statements, that process the most common situations, and leave the case construction, processing the more rare situations, in the end, before the default constructions. Another good practice is to  arrange the case labels in ascending order, regardless of whether they are integral or symbolic.\n\n\nTesting in The Judge System\nTest your solution here: https://judge.softuni.org/Contests/Practice/Index/931#8.\nMultiple Labels in Switch-Cases\nIn JavaScript, we can use multiple case labels, when they have to execute the same code.

He is very keen on volleyball, but he is very busy during weekdays and plays volleyball only during weekends and on holidays. Vlady plays in Sofia every Saturday when he is not working, and he is not traveling to his hometown, and also during 2/3 of the holidays. He travels to his hometown h times a year, where he plays volleyball with his old friends on Sunday. Vlady is not working 3/4 of the weekends, during which he is in Sofia. Furthermore, during leap years Vlady plays 15% more volleyball than usual. We accept that the year has exactly 48 weekends, suitable for volleyball. \nWrite a program, that calculates how many times Vlady has played volleyball through the year. Round the result down to the nearest integer (e.g. 2.15 -> 2; 9.95 -> 9).\nThe input data is read from the console:\n\nThe first line contains the word “leap” (leap year) or “normal” (a year has 365 days).\nThe second line contains the integer p – the count of holidays in the year (which are not Saturday or Sunday).\nThe third line contains the integer h – the count of weekends, in which Vlady travels to his hometown.\n\nSample Input and Output\n\n\n\nInput\nOutput\nInput\nOutput\n\n\n\n\nleap52\n45\nnormal32\n38\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInput\nOutput\nInput\nOutput\n\n\n\n\nnormal116\n44\nleap01\n41\n\n\n\nHints and Guidelines\nAs usual, we read the input data from the console and, to avoid making mistakes, we convert the text into small letters with the method .toLowerCase().

Now let's apply this knowledge to create something interesting: a desktop application, that visualizes a point in a rectangle. This is a wonderful visualization of one of the tasks from the exercises.\nLab: * Point in a Rectangle – (GUI) Application\nThe task we have is to develop a graphical (GUI) application for visualizing a point in a rectangle. The application must look like identically the following:\n\nUsing the controls on the left we set the coordinates of  two of the angles of the rectangle (decimal numbers) and the coordinates of the point. The application visualizes graphically the rectangle and the point and prints whether the point is inside the rectangle (Inside),  outside of it (Outside), or on one of the sides (Border). The application moves and resizes the coordinates of the rectangle and the point to be maximum large, but to fit the field for visualization, on the right side of the application.\n\nAttention: this application is significantly more complex than the previous graphical applications, which we have to develop until now because it requires using functions for drawing (Canvas ), work with HTML, JavaScript, and GUI framework (Electron).\n\n\nFollow the instructions for building the application step by step:\n\nWe will first create a separate folder for the project of our application with a suitable name, for example: \"Point-in-Rectangle\".\n\nElectron – working frame (framework) for creating graphical (GUI) applications with JavaScript. We execute the following command on the console (Command Prompt / Bash):\nnpm install -g electron\n\nIn the project folder, we create a JavaScript file named main.js using the keyboard shortcut  [Ctrl + N] in VS Code. After that, we save the new file by using [Ctrl + Shift + S] and entering the desired file name.\n\nThe code, described in main.js, manages the events and creates new windows in the application. It should look like the following code below: \n\n\nconst path = require('path');\nconst url = require('url');\nconst { app, BrowserWindow } = require('electron');\n\nlet win;\n\nfunction createWindow () {\n    win = new BrowserWindow({width: 750, height: 300, resizable: false});\n    win.loadURL(url.format({\n        pathname: path.join(__dirname, 'index.html'),\n        protocol: 'file:',\n        slashes: true\n    }));\n\n    win.on('closed', () => { win = null; });\n}\n\napp.on('ready', createWindow);\n\napp.on('window-all-closed', () => { app.quit(); });\n\napp.on('activate', () => {\n    if (win === null) {\n        createWindow();\n    }\n});\n\n\nIn the project folder, we create an HTML file with the name index.html. The  tag is mandatory for every HTML document and defines its title. We open it and write \"Point in Rectangle\":\n\n\nWe add the following code under the  in the index.html file:\n\n\n\nIn this way the connection bettween the files index.html and app.js (which we will create later) is realized. The   tag defines the body of the html document. We write in it the following code:\n\n    \n        \n        Rectangle X1:\n        \n        \n\n        Rectangle Y1:\n        \n        \n\n        Rectangle X2:\n        \n        \n\n        Rectangle Y2:\n        \n        \n\n        Point X:\n        \n        \n\n        Point Y:\n        \n        \n\n        \n        \n\n        \n            Status:\n            \n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            This text is displayed if your browser does not support HTML5 Canvas.\n        \n    \n\n\nTo enter the coordinates of the rectangle and the point, we use input fields of type Number, with tags . To draw geometric figures in the application, we use the html tag :\n\n\nIt accepts the following parameters:\n\nWidth (width) in pixels (px)\nHeight (height) in pixels (px)\nBorder (border)\n\nTo have your changes stored in the application, the files must be saved with [Ctrl+S].\nTo start the application, run the following command in the console (in the folder of the current project): \nelectron .\nThe application should look like the following:\n\n\nThe most complicated part remains to be implemented: visualization of the rectangle and the point at the field of the element  by using the function draw() in the file app.js, which we create in the directory of the application, in the way described at Point 2.\n\nWe create  CanvasRenderingContext2D an object by writing the following code:\n// Create canvas element\nlet canvas = document.getElementById('a');\nlet context = canvas.getContext('2d');\n\nThe  element is a field, in which the object generated with the method .getContext('2d'), is drawing graphics, text, images and other elements. In this case, the context variable represents this object. We store in separate variables the coordinates of the two angles of the rectangle:\n// Get input for rectangle coordinates\nlet rectX1 = Number(document.getElementById(\"rect-x1\").value) * 10;\nlet rectY1 = Number(document.getElementById(\"rect-y1\").value) * 10;\nlet rectX2 = Number(document.getElementById(\"rect-x2\").value) * 10;\nlet rectY2 = Number(document.getElementById(\"rect-y2\").value) * 10;\n\nThe coordinate values are accesible through the id of the  fields. For better visualization of the screen, we scale the values by increasing them 10 times. The next step is to calculate the sides of the rectangle, because the object context draws a rectangle on four parameters: x - coordinate, y  coordinate, width in pixels and height in pixels:\n// Calculate rectangle parameters\nlet rectWidth = Math.abs(rectX1 - rectX2);\nlet rectHeight = Math.abs(rectY1 - rectY2);\n\nWe can use the code below, which draws a red rectangle, according to the coordinates given in the form, using the method .strokeRect(...):\n// Set rectangle style\ncontext.strokeStyle = \"#ff0000\";\ncontext.lineWidth = 3;\n\n// Draw rectangle with given parameters\ncontext.strokeRect(rectX1, rectY1, rectWidth, rectHeight);\n\nSimilar to the rectangle, we take the coordinates of the point and scale them. After that, we set the style of the point - orange color. For better visualization of the screen, we convert the point into a circle with the method .arc(...). This method accepts five parameters: x - coordinate, y - coordinate, radius, start of the arc in radians, end of the arc radians:\n// Get input for point coordinates\nlet pointX = Number(document.getElementById(\"point-x\").value) * 10;\nlet pointY = Number(document.getElementById(\"point-y\").value) * 10;\n\n// Set point style and draw point\ncontext.beginPath();\ncontext.fillStyle = \"#ffcc00\";\ncontext.arc(pointX, pointY, 4, 0, 2 * Math.PI);\ncontext.closePath();\ncontext.fill();\n\nTo reflect the results in the if checks, we store the following elements of the html code in separate variables:\n// Assign variables to () and () html elements\nlet result = document.getElementById(\"status\");\nlet output = document.getElementById(\"result\");\n\nThe last step is to check the position of the point relative to the rectangle:\n// Check point position\nif () {\n    result.innerHTML = \"Inside\";\n    output.style.backgroundColor = \"palegreen\";\n} else if () {\n    result.innerHTML = \"Border\";\n    output.style.backgroundColor = \"gold\";\n} else {\n    result.innerHTML = \"Outside\";\n    output.style.backgroundColor = \"lightsalmon\";\n}\n\nLet's now think about how to add the unfinished (on purpose) conditions in the if constructions. The code above is intentionally not compiled, because its purpose is to make the reader think about how and why it works and to complete the missing parts. The code above takes the coordinates of the rectangle and the point checks whether the point is inside, outside, or on the side of the rectangle. When the result is visualized, the background color of the text block that contains it also changes.\nThis is the full version of the function draw():\nfunction draw() {\n    // Create canvas element\n    let canvas = document.getElementById('a');\n    let context = canvas.getContext('2d');\n\n    // Clear canvas window\n    context.clearRect(0, 0, canvas.width, canvas.height);\n\n    // Get input for rectangle coordinates\n    let rectX1 = Number(document.getElementById(\"rect-x1\").value) * 10;\n    let rectY1 = Number(document.getElementById(\"rect-y1\").value) * 10;\n    let rectX2 = Number(document.getElementById(\"rect-x2\").value) * 10;\n    let rectY2 = Number(document.getElementById(\"rect-y2\").value) * 10;\n\n    // Calculate rectangle parameters\n    let rectWidth = Math.abs(rectX1 - rectX2);\n    let rectHeight = Math.abs(rectY1 - rectY2);\n\n    // Set rectangle style\n    context.strokeStyle = \"#ff0000\";\n    context.lineWidth = 3;\n\n    // Draw rectangle with given parameters\n    context.strokeRect(rectX1, rectY1, rectWidth, rectHeight);\n\n    // Get input for point coordinates\n    let pointX = Number(document.getElementById(\"point-x\").value) * 10;\n    let pointY = Number(document.getElementById(\"point-y\").value) * 10;\n\n    // Set point style and draw point\n    context.beginPath();\n    context.fillStyle = \"#ffcc00\";\n    context.arc(pointX, pointY, 4, 0, 2 * Math.PI);\n    context.closePath();\n    context.fill();\n\n    // Assign variables to (div id=\"result\") and (span id=\"status\") html elements\n    let result = document.getElementById(\"status\");\n    let output = document.getElementById(\"result\");\n\n    // Check point position\n    if (pointX > rectX1 && pointX  rectY1 && pointY = rectY1 && pointY = rectX1 && pointX \nWe start the application through the file index.html and test it (by entering the different input data). We try to enter different rectangles and locate the point at different positions, resize the application and see if it behaves correctly. If the application does not work correctly, we check for errors. The most likely cause for an error is if we wrote the code in the wrong place.\nAt last, we start the application in our own GUI window: \nelectron .\nCase 1: The Point is in The Rectangle:\n\nCase 2: The Point Lies on One of The Sides of The Rectangle:\n\nCase 3: The Point is Outside The Rectangle:\n\nIf you have problems with the last task, feel free to ask in the SoftUni Reddit: https://www.reddit.com/r/softuni/.\n"},"chapter-04-complex-conditions-exam-problems.html":{"url":"chapter-04-complex-conditions-exam-problems.html","title":"4.2. More Complex Conditions – Exam Problems","keywords":"","body":"Chapter 4.2. More Complex Conditions – Exam Problems\nThe previous chapter introduced you to nested conditions in JavaScript. Via nested conditions, the program logic in a particular application can be represented using if conditional statements that are nested one into another. We also explained the switch-case conditional statement that allows selecting from a list of options. Now we are going to solve some practical exercises and make sure we have an in-depth understanding of the material, by discussing a set of more complex problems that had been given to students on exams. Before moving to the problems, let's first recall what nested conditions are:\nNested Conditions\nif (condition1) {\n    if (condition2)\n        // body; \n    else\n        // body;\n}\n\n\nRemember that it is not a good practice to write deeply nested conditional statements (with more than three levels of nesting). Avoid nesting of more than three conditional statements inside one another. This complicates the code and makes its reading and understanding difficult.\n\n\nSwitch-Case Conditions\nWhen the program operation depends on the value of a variable, instead of doing consecutive checks with multiple if-else blocks, we can use the switch-case conditional statement.\nswitch (selector) {\n    case value1:\n        statement;\n        break;\n    case value2:\n        statement;\n        break;\n    default:\n        statement;\n        break;\n}\n\nThe structure consists of:\n\nSelector - an expression that calculates a particular value.\nMultiple case labels followed by commands, ending in a break.\n\nExam Problems\nNow, after we refreshed our knowledge on how to use and nested conditional statements to implement more complex conditions and program logic, let's solve some exam problems.\nProblem: On Time for The Exam\nA student has to attend an exam at a particular time (for example at 9:30 am). They arrive in the exam room at a particular time of arrival (for example 9:40 am). It is considered that the student has arrived on time if they have arrived at the time when the exam starts or up to half an hour earlier. If the student has arrived more than 30 minutes earlier, the student has come too early. If they have arrived after the time when the exam starts, they are late.\nWrite a program that inputs the exam starting time and the time of student's arrival, and prints if the student has arrived on time, if they have arrived early or if they are late, as well as how many hours or minutes the student is early or late.\nInput Data\nRead the following four integers (arguments):\n\nThe first line (argument) contains the exam starting time (hours) – an integer from 0 to 23.\nThe second line (argument) contains the exam starting time (minutes) – an integer from 0 to 59.\nThe third line (argument) contains the hour of arrival – an integer from 0 to 23.\nThe fourth line (argument) contains minutes of arrival – an integer from 0 to 59.\n\nOutput Data\nPrint the following on the first line on the console:\n\n\"Late\", if the student arrives later compared to the exam starting time.\n\"On time\", if the student arrives exactly at the exam starting time or up to 30 minutes earlier.\n\"Early\", if the student arrives more than 30 minutes before the exam starting time.\n\nIf the student arrives with more than one minute difference compared to the exam starting time, print on the next line:\n\n\"mm minutes before the start\" for arriving less than an hour earlier.\n\"hh:mm hours before the start\" for arriving 1 hour or earlier. Always print minutes using 2 digits, for example \"1:05\".\n\"mm minutes after the start\" for arriving more than an hour late.\n\"hh:mm hours after the start\" for arriving late with 1 hour or more. Always print minutes using 2 digits, for example \"1:03\".\n\nSample Input and Output\n\n\n\nInput\nOutput\nInput\nOutput\n\n\n\n\n930950\nLate20 minutes after the start\n16001500\nEarly1:00 hours before the start\n\n\n900830\nOn time30 minutes before the start\n9001030\nLate1:30 hours after the start\n\n\n14001355\nOn time5 minutes before the start\n1130812\nEarly3:18 hours before the start\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInput\nOutput\n\n\n\n\n10001000\nOn time\n\n\n11301055\nEarly35 minutes before the start\n\n\n11301229\nLate59 minutes after the start\n\n\n\nHints and Guidelines\n\nIt is recommended to read the assignment a few times, take notes and sketch the examples while thinking before you start with the code.\n\nProcessing The Input Data\nAccording to the assignment, we expect four lines containing different integers to be passed. Examining the provided parameters, we can use the Number type, as it is suitable for the expected values. We simultaneously read the input data and parse the string value to the selected data type for the integer.\n\nExamining the expected output, we can create variables that contain the different output data types, to avoid using the so-called \"magic strings\" in the code.\n\nCalculations\nAfter reading the input data, we can now start writing the logic for calculating the result. Let's first calculate the start time of the exam in minutes for easier and more accurate comparison:\n\nLet's also calculate the student arrival time using the same logic:\n\nWhat remains is to calculate the difference between the two times, to determine when and what time compared to the exam time the student arrived at:\n\nOur next step is to do the required checks and calculations, and finally, we will print the output. Let's separate the code into two parts. \n\nFirst, let's show when the student arrived – were they early, late or on time. To do that, we will use an if-else statement. \nAfter that, we will show the time difference, if the student arrives at a different time compared to the exam starting time.\n\nTo spare one additional check (else), we can, by default, assume that the student was late. \nAfter that, according to the condition, we will check whether the difference in times is more than 30 minutes. If this is true, we assume that the student is early. If we do not match the first condition, we need to check if the difference is less than or equal to zero (), by which we are checking the condition whether the student arrived within the range of 0 to 30 minutes before the exam. \nIn all other cases, we assume that the student was late, which we set as default, and no additional check is needed:\n\nFinally, we need to understand and print what is the time difference between exam start time and student arrival time, as well as whether this time difference indicates the time of arrival before or after the exam start.\nWe check whether the time difference is more than one hour, to print hours and minutes in the required format, or less than one hour, to print only minutes as a format and description. \nWe also need to do one more check – whether the time of student's arrival is before or after the exam start time.\n\nPrinting The Result\nFinally, what remains is to print the result on the console. According to the requirements, if the student arrived right on time (not even a minute difference), we do not need to print a second result. This is why we apply the following condition:\n\nActually, for the task, printing the result on the console can be done at a much earlier stage – during the calculations. This, however, is not a very good practice. Why? Let's examine the idea that our code is not 10 lines, but 100 or 1000! One day, printing the result will not be done on the console, but will be written in a file or displayed as a web application. Then, how many places in the code you will make changes at, due to such a correction? Are you sure you won't miss some places?\n\nAlways consider the code that contains logical calculations as a separate part, different from the part that processes the input and output data. It has to be able to work regardless of how the data is passed to it and where the result will be displayed.\n\nTesting in The Judge System\nTest your solution here:  https://judge.softuni.org/Contests/Practice/Index/932#0.\nProblem: Trip\nIt is strange, but most people start planning their vacations well in advance. A young programmer from Bulgaria has a certain budget and spare time in a particular season.\nWrite a program that accepts as input the budget and season and as output displays programmer's vacation place and the amount of money they will spend.\nThe budget determines the destination, and the season determines what amount of the budget will be spent. If the season is summer, the programmer will go camping, if it is winter – he will stay in a hotel. If it is in Europe, regardless of the season, the programmer will stay in a hotel. Each camp or hotel, according to the destination, has its price, which corresponds to a particular percentage of the budget:\n\nIf 100 BGN or less – somewhere in Bulgaria.\nSummer – 30% of the budget.\nWinter – 70% of the budget.\n\n\nIf 1000 BGN or less – somewhere in the Balkans.\nSummer – 40% of the budget.\nWinter – 80% of the budget.\n\n\nIf more than 1000 BGN – somewhere in Europe.\nUpon traveling in Europe, regardless of the season, the programmer will spend 90% of the budget.\n\n\n\nInput Data\nThe input data will be read from the console and will consist of two lines (arguments):\n\nThe first line (argument) holds the budget – a real number in the range [10.00 … 5000.00].\nThe second line (argument) holds one of two possible seasons that are \"summer\" or \"winter\".\n\nOutput Data\nTwo lines must be printed on the console.\n\nOn the first line – \"Somewhere in {destination}\" among \"Bulgaria\", \"Balkans\" and \"Europe\".\nOn the second line – \"{Vacation type} – {Amount spent}\".\nThe Vacation can be in a \"Camp\" or \"Hotel\".\nThe Amount must be rounded up to the second digit after the decimal point.\n\n\n\nSample Input and Output\n\n\n\nInput\nOutput\n\n\n\n\n50summer\nSomewhere in BulgariaCamp - 15.00\n\n\n75winter\nSomewhere in BulgariaHotel - 52.50\n\n\n312summer\nSomewhere in BalkansCamp - 124.80\n\n\n678.53winter\nSomewhere in BalkansHotel - 542.82\n\n\n1500summer\nSomewhere in EuropeHotel - 1350.00\n\n\n\nHints and Guidelines\nTypically, as for the other tasks, we can separate the solution into the following parts:\n\nReading the input data\nDoing calculations\nPrinting the result\n\nProcessing The Input Data\nWhile reading carefully the requirements, we understand that we expect two parameters of input data. Our first parameter is a real number, for which we need to pick an appropriate variable type. For a higher level of calculation accuracy, we can pick Number as a variable for the budget and – String for the season.\n\n\nAlways take into consideration what value type is passed in the input data, as well as what type these need to be converted to, for the program conditions to work properly!\n\n\nCalculations\nLet's create and initialize the variables needed for applying the logic and calculations:\n\nSimilar to the example in the previous task, we can initialize variables with some of the output results, to spare additional initialization.\nWhen examining once again the problem requirements, we notice that the main distribution of where the vacation will take place is determined by the value of the budget, i.e. our main logic is divided into two cases: \n\nIf the budget is less than a particular value.\nIf it is less than another value or is more than the specified border value.\n\nBased on the way we arrange the logical scheme (the order in which we will check the border values), we will have more or fewer conditions in the solution. Think why!\nAfter that, we need to apply a condition to check the value of the season. Based on it, we will determine what percentage of the budget will be spent, as well as where the programmer will stay – in a hotel or a camp.\nThis is a sample code that may be used to implement the above idea:\n\nWe can optimize the conditions checking by assigning a default value and then checking one variant less. This saves one logical step.\nFor example, this block:\n\ncan be shortened like this:\n\nPrinting The Result\nWhat remains is to display the calculated result on the console:\n\nTesting in The Judge System\nTest your solution here: https://judge.softuni.org/Contests/Practice/Index/932#1.\nProblem: Operations\nWrite a program that reads two integers (n1 and n2) and an operator that performs a particular mathematical operation with them. Possible operations are: summing up (+), subtraction (-), multiplying (*), division (/) and modular division (%). Upon summing up, subtracting, and multiplying, the console must print the result and display whether it is an even or an odd number. Upon regular division – just the result, and upon modular division – the remainder. You need to take into consideration the fact that the divisor can be equal to zero (= 0) and dividing by zero is not possible. In this case, a special notification must be printed.\nInput Data\n3 arguments are passed to the function:\n\nN1 – integer within the range [0 … 40 000].\nN2 – integer within the range [0 … 40 000].\nOperator – one character among: \"+\", \"-\", \"*\", \"/\", \"%\".\n\nOutput Data\nPrint the output as a single line on the console:\n\nIf the operation is summing up, subtraction or multiplying:\n\"{N1} {operator} {N2} = {output} – {even/odd}\".\n\n\nIf the operation is division:\n\"{N1} / {N2} = {output}\" – the result is formatted up to the second digit after the decimal point.\n\n\nIf the operation is modular division:\n\"{N1} % {N2} = {remainder}\".\n\n\nIn case of dividing by 0 (zero):\n\"Cannot divide {N1} by zero\".\n\n\n\nSample Input and Output\n\n\n\nInput\nOutput\nInput\nOutput\n\n\n\n\n12312/\n123 / 12 = 10.25\n1120/\nCannot divide 112 by zero\n\n\n103%\n10 % 3 = 1\n100%\nCannot divide 10 by zero\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInput\nOutput\n\n\n\n\n1012+\n10 + 12 = 22 - even\n\n\n101-\n10 - 1 = 9 - odd\n\n\n73*\n7 * 3 = 21 - odd\n\n\n\nHints and Guidelines\nThe problem is not complex, but there are a lot of code lines to write.\nProcessing The Input Data\nUpon reading the requirements, we understand that we expect three parameters of input data. The first two parameters are integers (within the specified range), and the third one – an arithmetical symbol. \n\nCalculations\nLet's create and initialize the variables needed for the logic and calculations. In one variable we will store the calculations output, and in the other one, we will use it for the final output of the program.\n\nWhen carefully reading the requirements, we understand that there are cases where we don't need to do any calculations, and simply display a result.\nTherefore, we can first check if the second number is 0 (zero), as well as whether the operation is a division or a modular division, and then initialize the output.\n\nLet's place the output as a value upon initializing the output parameter. This way we can apply only one condition – whether it is needed to recalculate or replace this output. \nBased on the approach that we choose, our next condition will be either a simple else or a single if. In the body of this condition, using additional conditions regarding the manner of calculating the output based on the passed operator, we can separate the logic based on the structure of the expected output. \nFrom the requirements we can see that for summing up (+), subtraction (-) or multiplying (*) the expected output has the same structure: \"{n1} {operator} {n2} = {output} – {even/odd}\", whereas for division (/) and modular division (%) the output has a different structure.\n\nWe finish the solution by applying conditions for summing up, subtraction, and multiplying:\n\nFor short and clear conditions, such as the above example for even and odd numbers, you can use a ternary operator. Let's examine the possibility to apply a condition with or without a ternary operator.\nWithout using a ternary operator the code is longer but easier to read:\n\nUpon using a ternary operator the code is much shorter, but may require additional efforts to read and understand the logic:\n\nPrinting The Output\nFinally, what remains is to print the calculated result on the console:\n\nTesting in The Judge System\nTest your solution here: https://judge.softuni.org/Contests/Practice/Index/932#2.\nProblem: Match Tickets\nA group of football fans decided to buy tickets for Euro Cup 2016. The tickets are sold in two price categories:\n\nVIP – 499.99 BGN (Bulgarian leva).\nNormal – Normal – 249.99 BGN (Bulgarian leva).\n\nThe football fans have a shared budget, and the number of people in the group determines what percentage of the budget will be spent on transportation:\n\n1 to 4 – 75% of the budget\n5 to 9 – 60% of the budget\n10 to 24 – 50% of the budget\n25 to 49 – 40% of the budget\n50 or more – 25% of the budget\n\nWrite a program that calculates whether the money left in the budget will be enough for the football fans to buy tickets in the selected category, as well as how much money they will have left or be insufficient.\nInput Data\nThe input data contains exactly 3 lines (arguments):\n\nThe first line (argument) contains the budget – a real number within the range [1 000.00 … 1 000 000.00].\nThe second line (argument) contains the category – \"VIP\" or \"Normal\".\nThe third line (argument) contains the number of people in the group – an integer within the range [1 … 200].\n\nOutput Data\nPrint the following on the console as one line:\n\nIf the budget is sufficient:\n\"Yes! You have {N} leva left.\" – where N is the amount of remaining money for the group.\n\n\nIf the budget is NOT sufficient:\n\"Not enough money! You need {M} leva.\" – where M is the insufficient amount.\n\n\n\nThe amounts must be formatted up to the second digit after the decimal point.\nSample Input and Output\n\n\n\nInput\nOutput\nExplanations\n\n\n\n\n1000Normal1\nYes!

We need to perform two different block calculations.\nBy the first set of calculations, we must understand what part of the budget has to be spent on transportation. You will notice that the logic for doing these calculations only depends on the number of people in the group. Therefore, we will do a logical breakdown according to the number of football fans.\nWe will use a conditional statement – a sequence of if-else blocks.\n\nBy the second set of calculations, we need to find out what amount will be needed for purchasing tickets for the group. According to the requirements, this only depends on the type of tickets that we need to buy. \nLet's use a switch-case conditional statement.\n\nOnce we have calculated the transportation costs and ticket costs, what remains is to calculate the final result and understand if the group of football fans will attend Euro Cup 2016 or not, by the provided the available parameters. \nFor the output, to spare one else condition in the construction, we will assume that the group can, by default, attend Euro Cup 2016.\n\nPrinting The Result\nFinally, we need to display the calculated result on the console.\nTesting in The Judge System\nTest your solution here: https://judge.softuni.org/Contests/Practice/Index/932#3.\nProblem: Hotel Room\nA hotel offers two types of rooms: studio and apartment.\nWrite a program that calculates the price of the whole stay for a studio and apartment.

For these two months, the price for a stay is the same for both types of accommodation – a studio or an apartment. Therefore, the only thing that remains is to apply an internal condition regarding the number of stays and recalculate the relevant price (if needed):\n\nTo some extent, the logic and calculations will be identical for the following months:\n\n\nAfter calculating the relevant prices and the total amount for the stay, now let's prepare the formatted result. Before that, we should store it in our output parameters – studioInfo and apartmentInfo:\n\nTo calculate the output parameters, we will use the .toFixed(Number) method. This method rounds the decimal number up to a specified number of characters after the decimal point.

Loops","keywords":"","body":"Chapter 5.1. Loops (Repetitions)\nIn this chapter, we will introduce the repeat blocks of commands, also known as \"loops\". We will write a set of loops, using the for operator in its simplest form. Finally, we will solve a few practical problems that require repetition of commands, using loops.\nRepeating Code Blocks (For Loops)\nIn programming, we often need to execute a block of commands multiple times. To do that we use loops. Let's look at one example of a for loop, which will loop through the numbers from 1 to 10 and print each one:\nfor (let i = 1; i \nThe loop starts with the operator for and loops through all values of a given variable in a given range, for example, all numbers from 1 to 10 included. For each value, it executes a sequence of commands.\nUpon declaring the loop you can specify a start value and an end value. The loop's body is usually in curly braces { } and contains one or more commands. The figure below shows the structure of a for loop:\n\nA for loop often circles 1 to n times (for example 1 to 10). The goal is to loop through the numbers 1, 2, 3, …, n sequentially and after each pass through the loop to perform a certain action. In the example above the variable i holds values from 1 to 10 and the current value is printed in the loop's body. The loop repeats 10 times and each of these repetitions is called an \"iteration\".\nProblem: Numbers from 1 to 100\nWrite a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. The program does not accept input and prints the numbers from 1 to 100 sequentially, each on a separate line.\nHints and Guidelines\nWe can solve this problem with a for loop which will pass through the numbers from 1 to 100 using the variable i and will print the numbers in the loop's body:\n\nStart the program with [Ctrl+F5] and test it:\n\nTesting in The Judge System\nTest your solution here: https://judge.softuni.org/Contests/Practice/Index/933#0.\nYou should get 100 points (completely correct solution).\nCode Snippet for a For loop in Visual Studio Code\nWhile programming, we often need to use loops, dozens of times a day.

Using a for loop that iterates n times (n = args[0]), we read one integer number num on each iteration.

We must use a neutral start value upon finding the minimum / maximum, for example 1000000.0 and -1000000.0. If the final result is the neutral value, print “No”.\nTesting in The Judge System\nTest your solution here: https://judge.softuni.org/Contests/Practice/Index/933#10.\nProblem: Equal Pairs\nThere are 2 * n numbers. The first and the second number form a pair, so do the third and the fourth number, and so on. Each pair has a value – the sum of its numbers. Write a program that checks whether all pairs have the same value.\nIn case the value is the same, print \"Yes, value=…\" + the value, otherwise, print the maximum difference between two consecutive pairs in the following format - \"No, maxdiff=…\" + the maximum difference. \nThe input holds the number n, followed by 2*n integers, all of them on a separate line.\nSample Input and Output\n\n\n\nInput\nOutput\nComment\n\n\n\n\n312034-1\nYes, value=3\nvalues = {3, 3, 3}same values\n\n\n21222\nNo, maxdiff=1\nvalues = {3, 4}difference = {1}max. difference = 1\n\n\n411312200\nNo, maxdiff=4\nvalues = {2, 4, 4, 0}difference = {2, 0, 4}max. difference = 4\n\n\n155\nYes, value=10\nvalues = {10}only one valuesame values\n\n\n2-100-1\nYes, value=-1\nvalues = {-1, -1}same values\n\n\n2-120-1\nNo, maxdiff=2\nvalues = {1, -1}difference = {2}max. difference = 2\n\n\n\nHints and Guidelines\nRead the numbers from the input in pairs. For each pair calculate its sum. As we read the number pairs from the input, for each pair, except for the first one, we must calculate the difference with the previous one. To do that, we need to store the sum of the previous pair in a separate variable. Finally, find the biggest difference between the two pairs. If it is 0, print “Yes” + the value, otherwise - “No” + the difference.\nTesting in The Judge System\nTest your solution here: https://judge.softuni.org/Contests/Practice/Index/933#11.\nLab: Graphics and Web Applications\nIn this chapter, we learned about loops as a programming construction that allows us to repeat a particular action or a group of actions multiple times. Now let's play with them. To do that, we will draw several figures, which consist of a large number of repetitive graphic elements, and this time we will not do it on the console, but in a graphical environment, using \"turtle graphics\". It will be interesting. And it's not complicated at all. Try it!\nProblem: Drawing with a Turtle – a Graphical Application (GUI)\nThe purpose of the next exercise is to play with a drawing library, also known as turtle graphics. We will build a graphical application in which we will draw different shapes, moving our “turtle” on the screen through commands like “move 100 positions forward”, “turn 30 degrees to the right”, “move 50 positions more forward”. The application will look something like this:\n\nFirst, let's check out the drawing concept “Turtle Graphics”. Take a look at the following sources:\n\nDefinition of “turtle graphics”: https://wiki.c2.com/?TurtleGraphics\nArticle on “turtle graphics” in Wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turtle_graphics\n\nWe will build the application, using the following technologies:\n\nHTML language – to describe the user interface (drawing field and buttons).\nJavaScript code – to implement the actions of the buttons.\nJS library jQuery – to facilitate access to the user's interface.\nJS library jQuerу-Turtle – to implement screen drawing with the mechanics of “turtle graphics”.\n\nThere are two options to load all libraries and resources for our web application Turtle Graphics:\n\nLoading resources via CDN (Content Delivery Network).\n\nThis option is suitable when we have a permanent internet connection. We need to make a standard HTML file (for example index.html) and write the following code in it:\n\nAll the necessary resources will be loaded automatically when the file is started and we can directly write our JavaScript code.\nIf for some reason you don't have permanent access to the Internet, you can use the second option:\n\nLoading Resources Locally\n\nYou have to download all the necessary files and change a few lines in the HTML file. Start by creating a folder called Turtle-Demo and create the main HTML file and a subfolder for the necessary resources in it:\n\nIn the folder \"lib\" we need to put a few files that we can download from the book's online storage: https://github.com/SoftUni/Programming-Basics-Book-JS-EN/tree/master/assets/chapter-5-1-assets\nFor your convenience, we have put the files in an archive, easy to download Turtle-Graphics-Demo-Files.zip:\n\nLet's take a look at each one of them:\n\njquery.js (version 2.0.3)\n\nOne of the most popular JavaScript libraries which offers speed and functionality when working with HTML user interface. It changes the way we write code and plan its structure. Check out the tool at: https://jquery.com\n\njquery-turtle.js (version 2.0.8)\n\nA plugin, written by David Bau for jQuery - jQuery-turtle which provides a set of features for the graphic drawing of the \"turtle\" type. Find detailed information and rules of use here: https://github.com/davidbau/jquery-turtle\n\nstyle.css\n\nA set of design rules in a separate file.\n\nturtle-icon.png\n\nA raster graphic, which we use for a better presentation of the application.\nOnce we have put all files in one folder, we need to change the network address of the resources in our HTML file - index.html:\n\nAfter this change, each time you start the file, the browser will load the files locally from the \"lib\" folder.\nNow we can proceed to the fun part - writing the JavaScript code for the web application. It will be located in the last pair of script tags in the HTML file (index.html): \n \n\nThe code with the functions of the application will be relatively short (about 70-80 lines) and so we don't need to put it into a new separate file. The important thing is to place it correctly in our HTML file.\n\nIt is recommended that all JavaScript files be placed at the end of the HTML document before the final \"body\" tag. This guarantees the faster loading of the page because we do not delay the rendering (processing) of its elements.\n\n\nAlways insert the library file first [jquery.js], then the one with the plugin code [jquery-turtle.js]. Only then we will write our code because it's based on the first two files. If we try to change their places, we will get errors and our application will not work properly.\nThe library \"jQuery\" allows us to manipulate HTML elements, using valid design selectors (CSS). We have to apply a specific syntax:\n$('#ID') or $('.Class')\n\nWe can use the HTML element's name, ID, or its class. The selectors are always strings of text, so they are enclosed in single or double-quotes. If the selector is the ID (a separate name for each element), in the beginning, we put a sharp sign (#). But if we have decided to select by class (one name for multiple elements), then we write a dot.\nAdhering to the jQuery-turtle documentation, we have to initialize our object and set the basic characteristics of the \"turtle\". With the following code we will determine the size of the graph (turtleScale) and the speed of movement (turtleSpeed):\neval($.turtle());\n$('#turtle').css('turtleScale', '2').css('turtleSpeed', '4');\n\nOnce we are done with the basis of our application, we have to write the functions for each button. To do that, we use the selectors (ID) of the objects that we have preset in the HTML file. We will share the code for the first three buttons to get you acquainted with the basic principles:\n\n\"Draw\" Button\n\nWe attach a function to the element with an ID (selector) \"justDraw\", which will be activated the moment you click on the button:\n$('#justDraw').click(function() {\n    cg();\n    for (let index = 0; index \nFirst, erase the graphs with the function cg() (clear graphics) and write an elementary loop that repeats 4 times. We use the keyword let on purpose, to define the variable index. This way we guarantee the variable's autonomy for the specific loop and we can easily use the same name again.\nOn each iteration (repetition) we apply specific methods of movement with a certain value (turn to the left and move forward):\n.lt(30) // rotate to the left with an argument 30\n.fd(150) // move forward with an argument 150\n\nUsing the chaining technique saves additional code writing:\n$('#turtle').pen('blue', '5').lt(30).fd(150).lt(120) ...\n\n// which is a shorter version of the classic method:\n\n$('#turtle').pen('blue', '5');\n$('#turtle').lt(30);\n$('#turtle').fd(150);\n$('#turtle').lt(120);\n$('#turtle').fd(150);\n...\n\n\n\"Reset\" Button\n\nAttach a function to the element with an ID (selector) \"reset\", which will be activated at the moment of clicking:\n$('#reset').click(function() {\n    window.location.reload();\n});\n\nWith window.location.reload() we activate reloading the window, which resets its current state. It is important to note that the location is a feature of the object window, and reload() is a method of location.\n\n\"Hide Turtle\" Button\n\nAttach a function to the element with an ID (selector) \"hide\", which will be activated on clicking the button:\n$('#hide').click(function() {\n        $('#turtle').toggle();\n        $(this).text(function(i, text) {\n          return text === \"Hide Turtle\" ? \"Show Turtle\" : \"Hide Turtle\";\n      });\n});\n\nWe use a preset function from the library jQuery - toggle(). With its help, we can hide and show elements. Apart from that, we attach another function that changes the button's text when clicked. We have to use the keyword this. It plays an important role in the JavaScript language syntax and our thoughts we can replace it with self/itself. In this case, it is equal to the element hide, ie. this = #hide. We turn to the element itself and set a text changing function which is also activated each time the button is clicked.\nLet's sum up the code we have written so far:\n\neval($.turtle());\n$('#turtle').css('turtleScale', '2').css('turtleSpeed', '4');\n\n$('#reset').click(function() {\n    window.location.reload();\n});\n\n$('#justDraw').click(function() {\n    cg();\n    for (let index = 0; index \n\nThe only thing left to solve is the problem of automatically deleting the drawing field when a new button is clicked. We don't want the shapes to be drawn one over the other or to use the Reset button every time.\n\nFunction resetCanvas()\n\nfunction resetCanvas() {\n    cg();\n    home();\n    $('#turtle').css('turtleScale', '2').css('turtleSpeed', '4');\n}\n\nApply the preset functions in David Bau's plugin to erase all graph elements (cg()) and move the turtle to its starting position (home()). Then we set the initial settings of the turtle element once again. The whole function resetCanvas() is added at the beginning of each new function that will be attached to the other buttons.\nExample:\n$('#drawSpiral').click(function() {\n    resetCanvas();\n    $('#turtle').css('turtleSpeed', '4');\n    for (let index = 0; index \nIf you want, you can change the animation speed and the contour color by adding the new setting directly to the click(...) function and the function attached to it for each button:\n$('#turtle').css('turtleSpeed', '6').pen('red', '5');\n\nProblem: * Draw a Hexagon with The Turtle\nAdd a [Hexagon] button that draws a regular hexagon:\n\nHint:\nRepeat 6 times the following in a loop:\n\n60 degrees rotation.\nMove forward 90 steps.\n\nProblem: * Draw a Star with The Turtle\nAdd a [Star] button that draws a star with 5 beams (pentagram), as shown in the figure below:\n\nHint:\nChange the color: $(\"#turtle\").pen(\"green\", \"5\") \nRepeat 5 times the following in a loop:\n\nMove forward 180 steps.\n144 degrees rotation.\n\nProblem: * Draw a Spiral with The Turtle\nAdd a [Spiral] button that draws a spiral with 30 beams, as shown in the figure below:\n\nHint:\nDraw in a loop by moving forward and rotating.

Loops - Exam Problems","keywords":"","body":"Chapter 5.2. Loops – Exam Problems\nIn the previous chapter, we learned how to run a block of commands more than once. That's why we introduced a for loop and reviewed some of its main use cases. The purpose of this chapter is to improve our knowledge, by solving some more complex exam problems with loops, used for a practical exams. For some of them, we will show examples of comprehensive solutions, and for others, we will provide only guidance.\nBefore we start, let's take another look at the for loop construction:\n\nThe for loops consist of:\n\nInitialization expression, in which the variable-counter (let i) is created and its initial value is set. \nCondition expression (i ), executed once, before each loop iteration.\nIncrement expression (i++) – expression executed after each iteration.\nBody of the loop - contains any block of source code\n\nExam Problems\nLet's solve some SoftUni exam problems with loops\nProblem: Histogram\nN integers are given within the range of [1 … 1000]. A percentage of them p1 are with values below 200, another percentage p2 are with values from 200 to 399, percentage p3 are with values from 400 to 599, a percentage p4 are with values from 600 to 799 and the remaining percentage p5 representing values above 800.

Additionally, we have to declare the variables p1, p2, etc., in which we will store the count of numbers for each corresponding group.\nOnce the variables have been declared we can proceed with input data processing.\nProcessing The Input Data\nTo be able to read and distribute each number to its respective group, a for loop from 0 to n (count of numbers) will be used. Each loop iteration will read and distribute one single number (currentNum) to its respective group. To define, if a number belongs to a certain group we have to, perform a check in the respective range. Once the check returns true - we increase the count of numbers in this group (p1, p2, etc.) by 1:\n\nAfter determining the count of numbers in each group we can move on to the main objective and calculate the percentages. For the calculation we will use the following formula:\n(group percentage) = (count of numbers in a group) / (count of all numbers) * 100 \n\nThis formula in the source code would look as:\n\nAccording to the task assignment, the percentages have to be formatted with precision two digits after the decimal point. Considering this, .toFixed(...) method should be added to the formula and the first variable would look like this:\np1Percentage = (p1 / n * 100).toFixed(2);\n//Add the formula for the rest of the variables\n\nTo make it even clearer, let's take a look at the following example: \n\n\n\nInput\nOutput\n\n\n\n\n312999\n66.67%0.00%0.00%0.00%33.33%\n\n\n\nIn this case n = 3.\nFor this loop we have:\n\ni = 0 - we read the number 1, which is less than 200 and falls into the first group (p1), we increase the corresponding group counter by 1.\ni = 1 – we read the number 2, which again falls into the first group (p1) and we increase the same group counter by 1.\ni = 2 – we read the number 999, which falls into the last group (p5) because it's bigger than 800, and we increase the corresponding group counter by 1.\n\nAfter reading the numbers, we have in group p1 two numbers and in group p5 one number. For the rest of the groups, we have no numbers.

For each birthday she receives a present. For each odd birthday (1, 3, 5, …, n) she receives toys, and for the even birthdays (2, 4, 6, …, n) she receives money. For her second birthday, she received 10.00 USD, and the amount is increased by 10.00 USD for every subsequent even birthday (2 -> 10, 4 -> 20, 6 -> 30, etc.). Over the years Lily has secretly saved her money. In the years when Lily received money, her brother each time took 1 USD. Lily sold the toys, she got over the years, each one for P USD, and then added the sum to her savings. With her savings, she wanted to buy herself a washing machine for X USD. Write a program, that calculates the amount of Lily's savings and is this sum enough for buying a washing machine.\nInput Data\nThe program receives 3 numbers (arguments), entered by the user on separate lines:\n\nLily's age – integer in the range of [1 … 77].\nWashing machine price – a number in the range of [1.00 … 10 000.00].\nSingle toy price – integer in the range of [0 … 40].\n\nOutput Data\nIn a single line print on the console:\n\nIf Lily has enough money to make the purchase:\n\"Yes! {N}\" – where N is the money left after the purchase\n\n\nIf Lily's savings are not enough for making a purchase:\n\"No! {M}\" – where M is the insufficiency amount\n\n\nThe numbers N and M must be formatted with precision two digits after the decimal point.\n\nSample Input and Output\n\n\n\nInput\nOutput\nComments\n\n\n\n\n10170.006\nYes! 5.00\nFirst birthday receives toy; 2nd -> 10 USD; 3rd -> toy; 4th  -> 10 + 10 = 20 USD; 5th -> toy; 6th -> 20 + 10 = 30 USD; 7th -> toy; 8th -> 30 + 10 = 40 USD; 9th -> toy; 10th -> 40 + 10 = 50 USD.\nShe has saved -> 10 + 20 + 30 + 40 + 50 = 150 USD. She sold5 toys 6 USD each = 30 USD.\nHer brother took 1 USD 5 times. Remaining amount of money -> 150 + 30 – 5 = 175 USD.\n175 >= 170 (the price of the washing machine) she was able to buy the washing machine and she was left 175-170 = 5 USD.\n\n\n\n211570.983\nNo! 997.98\nShe saved 550 USD. She sold 11 toys 3 USD each. = 33 USD.Her brother has taken 1  USD each year for 10 years = 10 USD. Remaining amount of money 550 + 33 – 10 = 573 USD \n573  – She didn't manage to buy a washing machine. The insufficient amount of money is 1570.98–573 = 997.98 USD\n\n\n    \n\nHints and Guidelines\nSimilar to the previous problem, the solution could be divided into three parts – reading the input data, processing the input data, and printing the output.\n\nAgain, we should start with choosing appropriate variable names. For Lily's age(age), for the washing machine price (washingMachinePrice) and the single toy price (toyPrice). In the above code we declare and initialized (assign value to a variable) also variables for the toys count(toysCount), and money from birthdays (moneyFromBirthdays):\n\nWe use a for loop to iterate through every Lily's birthday. If the leading variable is an odd number, we increase the count of toys. We can do the parity check using division with the remainder (%) by 2 – if the remainder is equal to 0, the number is even, and if the remainder is equal to 1 - odd. Inversely, if the leading variable is an even number, that would mean, that Lily has received money so we have to add this amount of money to her savings. Then we Increase the value of the variable moneyFromBirthdays, i.e. we increase by 10 the sum, that she will receive for her next birthday. At the same time, we subtract 1 USD - the money taken from her brother. To use the decrement operator we have to add two minus signs after the last sign of the variable (moneyFromBirthdays--):\n\nProbably you will encounter some difficulties calculating the amount of birthday money  if you let the bonus money be added in the following way:\nmoneyFromBirthdays += 10;\n\nThe final result would be 10 x 5 = 50, while our goal is to have 10 + 20 + 30 + 40 + 50 = 150. The problem could be solved by declaring an additional variable(bonusMoney):\nbonusMoney += 10; \nmoneyFromBirthdays += bonusMoney;\n\nOr we can include the value of the variable i, which counts the loops and then divide it by 2:\nmoneyFromBirthdays += 10 * i/2;\n\nThen we have to add the money received from the sold toys to Lily's savings.\n\nAt this point what is left is to print the results considering the required formating i.e. the sum should be formatted with precision to the second digit after a decimal point:\n\nTo avoid declaring additional variables we can use a template literal - ${expression}. It's a text literal with a specific sequence of characters allowing embedding of expressions. Using it the calculation can be performed and the result to be directly included in the text string. \nTesting in The Judge System\nYou can test your solution here: https://judge.softuni.org/Contests/Practice/Index/934#1.\nProblem: Back to The Past\nIvan is 18 years old and just received an inheritance, consisting of X amount of money and a time machine. He decides to return to the year 1800, but he is not certain if the money would be enough for him, to live at that time without working. Write a program, that calculates if Ivan would have enough money, to live without working until a given year (inclusively). Assuming that, for every even (1800, 1802 etc.) year he would spend 12 000 USD. For every odd year (1801,1803 etc.) he would spend 12 000 + 50 * [the age he would have reached in the given year].\nInput Data\nThe program receives 2 numbers (arguments), entered by the user on separate lines\n\nInherited money – a number in the range of [1.00 … 1 000 000.00].\nThe year, until he would have to live in the past (inclusively) – an integer in the range of [1801 … 1900].\n\nOutput Data\nPrint on the console 1 line.

According to the problem description, Ivan is eighteen years old, so we could declare the variable years and set an initial value of 18. The values of the other variables we can read from the function parameters:\n\nUsing a for loop we can iterate through all the years. Starting from 1800 – the year, in which Ivan wants to return, and reach the year until which he has to live in the past. In the loop, we check, if the current year is even or odd. We perform the check using division with a remainder (%) by 2. If the year is even, we subtract from the (heritage) 12000, and if the year is odd, we subtract from the (heritage) 12000 + 50 * (the age he would have reached in the given year):\n\nFinally, we have to print out the result by checking whether the inheritance (heritage) was enough to live without working or not. If the inheritance (heritage) is a positive number, we print out: \"Yes! He will live a carefree life and will have {N} dollars left.\", and if it's a negative number: \"He will need {M} dollars to survive.\". Don't forget to format the result with precision to the second digit after the decimal point.\nHint: Consider using the Math.abs(…) method, when printing the output in case the inheritance is insufficient.\nTesting in The Judge System\nYou can test your solution here: https://judge.softuni.org/Contests/Practice/Index/934#2.\nProblem: Hospital\nFor a certain period, every day patients arrive at the hospital for examination. Initially, the hospital had 7 doctors. Each doctor could treat only one patient per day, but sometimes there is a shortage of doctors, so the remaining patients are sent to other hospitals. Every third day the hospital makes evaluations and if the count of untreated patients is greater than the count of treated ones, another doctor is appointed. Each new doctor is appointed at the beginning of the day before the patients' admission.\nWrite a program, that calculates for a given period, the count of treated and untreated patients.\nInput Data\nOn the first line (argument) there is an integer in the range of [1 … 1000] - The period, for which you need to make calculations. On the next lines (arguments) there are integers in the range of [1 … 10 000] – the number of arriving patients, for the current day.  \nOutput Data\nPrint on the console 2 lines:\n\nOn the first line: \"Treated patients: {count of treated patients}.\"\nOn the second line: \"Untreated patients: {count of untreated patients}.\"\n\nSample Input and Output\n\n\n\nInput\nOutput\nExplanation\n\n\n\n\n472791\nTreated patients: 23.Untreated patients: 21.\nDay 1: 7 treated and 0 untreated patients for the day\nDay 2: 7 treated and 20 untreated patients for the day\nDay 3: 14 patients have been treated so far and20 untreated –> A new doctor is appointed –>\n8 treated and 1 untreated patients for the day\nDay 4: 1 treated and 0 untreated patients for the day\nTotal: 23 treated and 21 untreated patients.\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\nInput\nOutput\n\n\n\n\n625252525252\nTreated patients: 40.Untreated patients: 87.\n\n\n3777\nTreated patients: 21.Untreated patients: 0.\n\n\n    \n\nHints and Guidelines\nWe start again by, declaring and initializing the required variables. The calculation period we read from the console and save in the period variable. We will need some additional variables such as the number of treated patients (treatedPatients), the number of untreated patients (untreatedPatients), and the number of doctors (countOfDoctors), which initially is set to 7.\n\nUsing for loop we iterate through all days in the given period (period). For each day, we read from the console the number of the patients(currentPatients). According to the problem description, the increase of the doctors can occur every third day, but only if the count of untreated patients is greater than the count of treated ones. For this purpose we check, if the day is the third one – using the division with a remainder operator (%): day % 3 == 0.\nFor example:\n\nIf it's the third day, the remainder of the division by 3 will be 0 (3 % 3 = 0) and the check day % 3 == 0 will return true.\nIf it's the second day, the remainder of the division by 3 will be 2 (2 % 3 = 2) and the check will return false.\nIf it's the fourth day, the remainder of the division by 1 (4 % 3 = 1) and the check will return false.\n\nIf day % 3 == 0 returns true, the program logic will check, if the number of untreated patients is greater than the treated ones: untreatedPatients > treatedPatients. If the result is again true, then the count of doctors will be increased (countOfDoctors).\nThen we have to check if the daily count of patients (currentPatients) is greater than the count of the doctors (countOfDoctors). If the count of patients is greater:\n\nIncrease the value of the variable treatedPatients by the count of doctors (countOfDoctors).\nIncrease the value of the variable untreatdPatients by the count of remaining patients, which we calculate by subtracting the count of doctors from the count of patients (currentPatients - countOfDoctors).\n\nIf the count of patients is not greater, we increase only the value of the variable treatedPatients by the count of patients for the day (currentPatients).\n\nFinally, the only thing left is to print the number of treated and untreated patients.\nTesting in The Judge System\nYou can test your solution here: https://judge.softuni.org/Contests/Practice/Index/934#3.\nProblem: Division\nN integers are given in the range of [1 … 1000]. Some percentage p1 of them are divisible without remainder by 2, percentage p2 are divisible without remainder by 3, percentage p3 is divisible without remainder by 4. Write a program that calculates and prints the percentages p1, p2, and p3.\nExample: We are given n = 10 numbers: 680, 2, 600, 200, 800, 799, 199, 46, 128, 65 and the following distribution and visualization:\n\n\n\nDivision without remainder by:\nNumbers\nCount\nPercent\n\n\n\n\n2\n680, 2, 600, 200, 800, 46, 128\n7\np1 = (7 / 10) * 100 = 70.00%\n\n\n3\n600\n1\np2 = (1 / 10) * 100 = 10.00%\n\n\n4\n680, 600, 200, 800, 128\n5\np3 = (5 / 10) * 100 = 50.00%\n\n\n   \n\nInput Data\nOn the first line (argument) of the input, we have integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000) – count of numbers. On each next n line, we have one integer in the range of [1 … 1000] – numbers that have to be checked for division without remainder.\nOutput Data\nPrint on the console 3 lines, each containing a percentage between 0% and 100%, formatted with precision two digits after the decimal point, for example 25.00%, 66.67%, 57.14%.\n\nOn the first line – the percentage of the numbers, which is divisible by 2.\nOn the second line – the percentage of the numbers, which is divisible by 3.\nOn the third line – the percentage of the numbers, which is divisible by 4.\n\nSample Input and Output\n\n\n\nInput\nOutput\nInput\nOutput\nInput\nOutput\n\n\n\n\n1068026002008007991994612865\n70.00%10.00%50.00%\n3369\n33.33%100.00%0.00%\n112\n100.00%100.00%100.00%\n\n\n   \n\nHints and Guidelines\nFor the current and for the next problem you will have to write the program code by yourself, following the given guidelines.\nThe program logic that solves the current problem is similar to the Histogram problem, that we reviewed above. Therefore we can start with declaring the required variables. Typical variable names could be n – count of numbers (that we need to read from the console) and divisibleBy2, divisibleBy3, divisibleBy4 – additional variables, containing a count of the numbers in the corresponding group.\nTo read and allocate each number to its corresponding group we have to iterate  for loop from 0 to n (count of numbers). Each iteration of the loop should read and allocate one single number. The difference here is that one number could be a part of several groups simultaneously, therefore we have to perform three different if checks for each number - respectively, whether the number is divisible by 2,3, and 4 and then to increase the value of the variable that keeps the count of numbers in the corresponding group.\nNote: if-else construction wouldn't work in this case, because once the condition is true, the code wouldn't perform any further checkings.\nFinally, you need to print the obtained results, by following the specified format.\nTesting in The Judge System\nYou can test your solution here: https://judge.softuni.org/Contests/Practice/Index/934#4.\nProblem: Logistics\nIn this problem, you are responsible for the logistics of various types of cargo Depending on the weight of each cargo you need a different vehicle and this will cost different prices per ton:\n\nUp to 3 tons – microbus (200 USD per ton).\nFrom over 3 to 11 tons – truck (175 USD per ton).\nOver 11 tons – train (120 per ton).\n\nYour task is to calculate the average price per ton of cargo, as well as the percentage of the cargo transported by each vehicle.\nInput Data\nThe program receives a sequence of numbers (arguments):\n\nOn the first line (argument): the count of cargos that have to be transported – integer in the range of [1 … 1000].\nOn the next lines, we pass the weight of the cargo – integer in the range of [1 … 1000].\n\nOutput Data\nPrint on the console 4 lines, as follow:\n\nLine #1 – average price per ton for a transported cargo (formatted with precision two digits after the decimal point).\nLine #2 – a percentage of the cargo, transported by microbus (between 0.00% and 100.00%, formatted with precision two digits after the decimal point).\nLine #3 – a percentage of the cargo, transported by truck (between 0.00% and 100.00%).\nLine #4 – a percentage of the cargo, transported by train (between 0.00% and 100.00%).\n\nSample Input and Output\n\n\n\nInput\nOutput\nExplanation\n\n\n\n\n415163\n143.8016.00%20.00%64.00%\n\nThe microbus is transporting two cargos 1 + 3, a total of 4 tons.\nThe truck is transporting one cargo: 5 tons.\nThe train is transporting one cargo: 16 tons.\nThe sum of all cargos is: 1 + 5 + 16 + 3 = 25 tons.\nPercentage of the cargo transported by microbus is: 4/25*100 = 16.00%\nPercentage of the cargo transported by truck is: 5/25*100 = 20.00%\nPercentage of the cargo transported by train is: 16/25*100 = 64.00%\nThe average price per ton trasported cargo should be: (4 * 200 + 5 * 175 + 16 * 120) / 25 = 143.80\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInput\nOutput\nInput\nOutput\n\n\n\n\n52102017\n149.387.50%42.50%50.00%\n453756999\n120.350.00%0.63%99.37%\n\n\n\n\nHints and Guidelines\nFirst, we will read the weight of each cargo and sum the amount of cargo transported by microbus, truck and train, then we have to calculate the total tons of transported cargo. The next step is to calculate the prices of each transport type related to the transported tons and the total price. Finally,  we will calculate and print the total average price per ton and what part of the cargo as a percentage is transported by each type of vehicle.\nWe declare the necessary variables such as countOfLoads – count of the cargos for transportation (we read them from the console), sumOfTons – the weight amount of all cargos, microbusTons, truckTons, trainTons – variables containing the amount of weight of transported cargo, respectively by the microbus, the truck, and the train. \nWe still need afor loop from 0 to countOfLoads - 1, to iterate through all cargo types. For each cargo, we read weight (in tons) and save the value in a variable, such as tons. Next, we add the weight of the current cargo (tons) to the sum of all cargo weights (sumOfTons). Once we have read the weight of the current cargo, we need to determine which vehicle type will be used (microbus, truck or train). For this purpose we should use if-else check:\n\nIf the value of the variable tons is less than 3, increase the value of microbusTons by the value of tons:\nmicrobusTons += tons;\n\n\nIn case the value of tons is less than 11 - increase the value of truckTons by the value of tons.\n\nIf the value of tons is more than 11, increase the value of trainTons by the value of tons.\n\nBefore printing the output, we have to calculate the percentage of tons, transported by each vehicle and the average price per ton. For the average price per ton, we will declare one more variable totalPrice, which will sum the total price of all transported cargo (by microbus, truck and train). We can calculate the average price by, dividing totalPrice by sumOfTons. Finally, you have to calculate by yourself the percentages of tons, transported by each vehicle, and print the results, keeping the format specified in the description.\nTesting in The Judge System\nYou can test your solution here: https://judge.softuni.org/Contests/Practice/Index/934#5.\n"},"chapter-06-nested-loops.html":{"url":"chapter-06-nested-loops.html","title":"6.1.

In each iteration of the outer loop, the whole inner loop is executed. This happens in the following way:\n\nWhen nested loops start executing, the outer loop starts first: the controlling variable is initialized and after a check for ending the loop the code in its body is executed.\nAfter that, the inner loop is executed. The controlling variables' start position is initialized, a check for ending the loop is made and the code in its body is executed.\nWhen reaching the specified value for ending the loop, the program goes back one step up and continues executing the previous outer loop. The controlling variable of the outer loop changes with one step, a check is made to see if the condition for ending the loop is met and a new execution of the nested (inner) loop is started.\nThis is repeated until the variable of the outer loop meets the condition to end the loop.\n\nHere is an example that illustrates nested loops. The aim is again to print a rectangle made of n *_ _n stars, in which for each row a loop iterates from 1 to n, and for each column a nested loop is executed from 1 to *n:\nfunction drawSquare(n) {\n    for (let i = 1; i \nLet's look at the example above. After initializing the first (outer) loop, its body, which contains the second (nested) loop starts executing. By itself, it prints on one row n number of stars. After the inner loop finishes executing at the first iteration of the outer one, the first loop will continue, i.e. it will print an empty row on the console. After that, the variable of the first loop will be renewed and the whole second loop will be executed again. The inner loop will execute as many times as the body of the outer loop executes, in this case, n times.\nProblem: Square of Stars\nWrite a program that draws on the console a square of N x N asterisks:\n\n\n\nInput\nOutput\nInput\nOutput\nInput\nOutput\n\n\n\n\n2\n* ** *\n3\n* * ** * ** * *\n4\n* * * ** * * ** * * ** * * *\n\n\n\nHints and Guidelines\nThe problem is similar to the previous one.

Once again, we will use nested loops, but there is a catch here. The difference is that the number of columns that we need to print depends on the row, on which we are and not on the input number n. From the example input and output data, we see that the count of dollars depends on which row we are on at the moment of the printing, i.e. 1 dollar means the first row, 3 dollars mean the third row, and so on. Let's see the following example in detail. We see that the variable of the nested loop is connected with the variable of the outer one.

For the printing of each part, we will use two separate loops, as we leave the reader to decide the dependency between n and the variables of the loops. For the first loop we can use the following guidelines:\n\nWe print n-row white spaces.\nWe print *.\nWe print row-1 times *.\n\nThe second (lower) part will be printed similarly, which again we leave to the reader to do.\n\nTesting in The Judge System\nTest your solution here: https://judge.softuni.org/Contests/Practice/Index/935#5.\nProblem: Christmas Tree\nWrite a program that takes a number n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) and prints a Christmas tree with a height of n+1.\n\n\n\nInput\nOutput\nInput\nOutput\n\n\n\n\n1\n  |  * | *\n2\n   |    * | * ** | **\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInput\nOutput\nInput\nOutput\n\n\n\n\n3\n    |      * | *   ** | ** *** | ***\n4\n     |        * | *     ** | **   *** | *** **** | ****\n\n\n\nHints and Guidelines\nFrom the examples, we see that the Christmas tree can be divided into three logical parts. The first part is the stars and the white spaces before and after them, the middle part is |, and the last part is again stars, but this time there are white spaces only before them.

A part of the code with which the problem can be solved is given below. When drawing the upper and lower rows we need to print 2 * n stars, n white spaces, and 2 * n stars:\n\nWhen drawing the middle part, we need to check if the row is (n-1) / 2 - 1, because in the examples we can see that in this row we need to print pipes instead of white spaces. The problem with (n - 1) / 2 - 1 is that it can be a number with the decimal remainder. Because of this, we must use a mathematical method for removing a decimal remainder - Math.floor(...).

What we see from the example input and output is that:\n\nThe house is divided into two parts: roof and base.\n\n\n\nWhen n is an even number, the point of the house is \"dull\".\nWhen n is odd, the roof is one row larger than the base.\n\nThe Roof\n\nIt comprises stars and dashes.\nIn the top part, there are one or two stars, depending on if n is even or odd (also related to the dashes).\nIn the lowest part, there are many stars and no dashes.\nWith each lower row, the stars increase by 2, and the dashes decrease by 2.\n\nThe Base\n\nThe height is n rows.\nIt is made out of stars and pipes.\nEach row comprises 2 pipes – one in the beginning and one at the end of the row, and also stars between the pipes with a string length of n - 2.\n\nWe gave n as a parameter to our function:\n\n\nIt is very important to check if the input data is correct! In these tasks, it is not a problem to directly convert the data from the console into Numbertype, because it is said that we will be given valid integers. If you are making more complex programs it is a good practice to check the data. What will happen if instead of the character \"A\" the user inputs a number?\n\n\nTo draw the roof, we write down how many stars we start with a variable called stars:\n\nIf n is an even number, there will be 2 stars.\nIf it is odd, there will be 1.\n\n\nCalculate the length of the roof. It equals half of n. Write the result in the variable roofLength.\n\nIt is important to note that when n is an odd number, the length of the roof is one row more than that of the base. In JavaScript language, when you divide two numbers with a remainder, the result will be a decimal number\nExample:\n    let result = 3 / 2; // result 1.5\n\nIf we want to round up to the next largest integer. number, we need to use the method Math.ceil(…): let result = Math.ceil(3 / 2);. The result from 3 / 2 is 1.5. Math.ceil(…) will round the number to the next largest integer. In our case 1.5 will be rounded to 2. parseInt() is used to transform the input parameter to type Number.\nAfter we have calculated the length of the roof, we make a loop from 0 to roofLength. On each iteration we will:\n\nCalculate the number of dashes we need to draw. The number will be equal to (n - stars) / 2. We store it in variable padding.\n\n\n\nWe print on the console: \"dash\" (padding / 2 times) + \"stars\" (stars times) + \"dash\" (padding / 2 times):\n\n\n\nBefore the iteration is over, we add 2 to stars (the number of the stars).\n\n\nAfter we have finished with the roof, it is time for the base.

We can mentally divide the diamond into 2 parts:\n\nUpper part. It starts from the upper tip down to the middle.\nLower part. It starts from the row below the middle one and goes down to the lower tip (inclusive).\n\nUpper Part\n\nIf n is an odd number, it starts with 1 star.\nIf n is an even number, it starts with 2 stars.\nWith each row down, the stars get further away from each other.\nThe space between, before, and after the stars is filled up with dashes.\n\nLower Part\n\nWith each row down, the stars get closer to each other. This means that space (the dashes) between them is getting smaller and space (the dashes) on the left and the right is getting larger.\nThe bottom-most part has 1 or 2 stars, depending on whether n is an even or odd number.\n\nUpper and Lower Parts of the Diamond\n\nOn each row, except the middle one, the stars are surrounded by inner and outer dashes.\nOn each row, there is space between the two stars, except on the first and the last row (sometimes the star is 1).\n\nAs an entering parameter n of our function we give it a Number value:\n\nWe start drawing the upper part of the diamond. The first thing we need to do is to calculate the number of the outer dashes leftRight (the dashes on the outer side of the stars). It is equal to (n - 1) / 2, rounded down. To round the number we will use the method Math.floor(...) to remove the residue. We can have this case if our input is odd.\n\nAfter we have calculated leftRight, we start drawing the upper part of the diamond. We can start by running a loop from 0 to n / 2 + 1 (rounded down). At each iteration of the loop the following steps must be taken:\n\n\nWe draw on the console the left dashes (with length leftRight) and right after them the first star:\n\n\n\n\n\nWe will calculate the distance between the two stars. We can do this by subtracting from n the number of the outer dashes, and the number 2 (the number of the stars, i.e. the diamond's outline). We need to store the result of the subtraction in a variable mid.\n\n\n\nIf the mid is lower than 0, we know that on the row there should be only 1 star. If it is higher or equal to 0 then we have to print dashes with length mid and one star after them.\n\nWe draw on the console the right outer dashes with length leftRight:\n\n\n\n\nAt the end of the loop, we decrease leftRight by 1 (the stars are moving away from each other).\n\nWe are ready with the upper part.\nPrinting the lower part is very similar to that of the upper part. The difference is that instead of decreasing leftRight with 1 at the end of the loop, we will increase leftRight with 1 at the beginning of the loop. Also, the loop will be from 0 to (n - 1) / 2.\n\nRepeating a code is considered bad practice because the code becomes very hard to maintain. Let's imagine that we have a piece of code (e.g. the logic for drawing a row from the diamond) at a few more places and we decide to change it. For this, we will have to go through all the places and change it everywhere. Now let's imagine that you need to reuse a piece of code not 1, 2, or 3 times but tens of times. A way to overcome this problem is to use functions. You can look for additional information for functions on the Internet or look at  Chapter “10” (Functions).\n\n\nIf we have written all correctly, then the problem is solved.\nTesting in The Judge System\nTest your solution here: https://judge.softuni.org/Contests/Practice/Index/935#9.\nWhat Have We Learned from This Chapter?\nWe learned how to use the repeat(...) method which constructs and returns a new object from type String:\nlet foo = \"*\".repeat(10);\n\nWe learned how to draw figures using nested for loops:\nfor (let i = 1; i \nLab: Drawing Ratings in Web\nNow that we got used to nested loops and the way to use them to draw figures on the console, we can get into something even more interesting: we can see how loops can be used to draw in a Web environment. We will make a web application that visualizes a number rating (a number from 0 to 100) with stars. This kind of visualization is common in e-commerce sites, reviews of products, event rating, rating of apps, and others.\nDon't worry if you don't understand all of the code, how exactly it is written and how the project works. It is normal, now we are learning to write code and we are a long way from the web development technologies. If you are struggling to write your project by following the steps, watch the video from the beginning of the chapter or ask for help in the SoftUni official discussion Reddit: https://www.reddit.com/r/softuni/.\nProblem: * Ratings – Visualization in a Web Environment\nYour task is to create a JavaScript web application for visualizing a rating (a number from 0 to 100). From 1 to 10 stars should be drawn with halves. The starts should be generated with a for loop.\nWe create an empty folder in our file system with the name \"ratings\". In there we create 2 files and one folder:\n\nindex.html\nscript.js\nimages (folder)\n\nNow we add images with stars (they are part of the resources of this lab which can be downloaded from here). We copy them from windows explorer and paste them into the folder images using copy/paste.\nWe open index.html and add the following code:\n\nThis code creates one input field input-rating, in which the user can add a number from [0 … 100] and a button [Draw] which when clicked calculates the value of the stars with their input value. The action which will approve the input data is called drawRating. After that the form will print the content of . The code which is inside it will be dynamically generated HTML with a series of stars.\nWe add the function drawRating() inside the file script.js, which has the following code:\n/**\n * drawRating, draws HTML, which is needed for the visualization of the stars\n * @param {Number} rating\n * @return {String} html\n */\nfunction drawRating(rating) {\n    // string from HTML\n    let html = \"\";\n\n    // total number of stars\n    let allStars = 10;\n\n    // all field stars\n    let fullStars = Math.floor(rating / allStars);\n\n    // all empty stars\n    let emptyStars = Math.floor((100 - rating) / allStars);\n\n    // all half-filled stars\n    let halfStars = allStars - fullStars - emptyStars;\n\n    // build of HTML\n    for (let i = 0; i ';\n    }\n    for (let i = 0; i ';\n    }\n    for (let i = 0; i ';\n    }\n\n    // return of created HTML\n    return html;\n}\n\nThe code above takes the number rating, makes some calculations to find the number of empty stars and the number of half-full stars, after which it generates an HTML code, which orders a few pictures of stars one after the other so that it can make the rating picture from them. The ready HTML code is returned as a result of the function and it is ready for further use. Up to this moment, the result from this point can't be used because we can't connect it to the button. We create a function named\ndrawHandler() with the following code:\n/**\n* drawHandler, a function that runs, when the user clicks on the button Draw\n * @return {Void}\n */\nfunction drawHandler() {\n    // Finds the input element, which stores the raiting and get its value\n    let ratingInput = document.getElementById(\"input-rating\");\n\n    // By default all values from the form come as \"string\"\n    // This is why we need to convert them using \"parseInt()\"\n    let rating = parseInt(ratingInput.value);\n\n    // We find the element which holds the stars\n    let ratingHolder = document.getElementById(\"ratingHolder\");\n\n    // Generated HTML from our input rating\n    let html = drawRating(rating);\n\n    // draw of a page\n    ratingHolder.innerHTML = html;\n}\n\nOur function drawHandler() makes several things:\n\nFinds the HTML element, which holds the rating (input-rating) and gets its value.\nConverts value from string to a number.\nFinds the HTML element that will hold the stars (ratingHolder).\nGenerates HTML of the stars, using drawRating(...) function.\nPlaces the generated HTML using innerHTML method inside the element ratingHolder.\n\nWe need one more function that will combine the above 2 functions and connect them to the HTML elements. This function is called appInit(). The name hints that its role will be to initialize our application. We add the following code in our function appInit():\n/**\n * appInit is responsible for our initial run of the application\n * @return {Void}\n */\nfunction appInit() {\n    // finds the button element inside our HTML\n    let button = document.getElementById(\"input-draw\");\n\n    // Adds \"click\" event to perform the drawing\n    button.addEventListener(\"click\", drawHandler);\n\n    // Initial draw of the rating\n    drawHandler();\n}\n\nAfter we have all the needed functions it's time to start our application. Keep in mind that script.js is added at the end of our file (after the closing tag of ). This is a good practice and gives us faster loading of the DOM tree. This allows us to run the following JavaScript code, which uses HTML elements. Because of these conditions, we can be sure that all conditions are already loaded inside the memory of our browser.\nHowever, instead of calling directly appInit() at the end of the file, we will use one more good practice:\n/**\n * Stars the application asynchronous using \"event listener\".\n * Listens for \"DOMContentLoaded\".\n */\ndocument.addEventListener(\"DOMContentLoaded\", appInit);\n\nThe event DOMContentLoaded confirms that the browser has finished will all actions connected to the creation of the DOM tree. Adding to it using addEventListener(...) provides it with a correct run of our JavaScript program.\nWhen the browser is ready, it will run our starting function appInit(). The result from our function is:\n\nHooks our function drawHandler() to the click event of the Draw button.\nInitial call of drawHandler() is to fill the stars from our current HTML.\n\nIf you have a problem with the project above watch the video at the beginning of this chapter.

Nested Loops – Exam Problems","keywords":"","body":"Chapter 6.2. Nested Loops – Exam Problems\nIn the previous chapter, we introduced nested loops and how to use them for drawing various kinds of figures on the console.

The left and the right inner columns have a width of n / 2.\nInput Data\nThe program input consists one element (argument) - integer n within the range [3 … 1000].\nOutput Data\nPrint on the console n text lines, depicting the fortress, just as in the examples below.\nSample Input and Output\n\n\n\nInput\nOutput\nInput\nOutput\n\n\n\n\n3\n/^\\/^\\|    |\\_/\\_/\n4\n/^^\\/^^\\|      ||      |\\__/\\__/\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInput\nOutput\nInput\nOutput\n\n\n\n\n5\n/^^\\__/^^\\|        ||        ||   __   |\\__/  \\__/\n8\n/^^^^\\____/^^^^\\|              ||              ||              ||              ||              ||     ____     |\\____/    \\____/\n\n\n\nHints and Guidelines\nBy the set task condition, we can see that the input data will contain only one integer within the range [3 … 1000], therefore we have to create a function, that receives as an argument an array with one element. Because we have to work with numbers, we can use the method Number() as a function, to convert the received argument from a string to a number type: \n\nAfter we've declared and initialized the input data, we have to divide the fortress into three parts:\n\nroof\nbody\nbase\n\nWe can see from the examples, that the roof consists of two towers and a middle part. Each tower has a beginning /, middle part ^ and an end \\.\nBy the set task condition the left and the right inner columns have a width of n / 2, therefore we can save this value as a separate variable, keeping in mind, that if we receive an odd number as input, the result of dividing by two will be a number with a whole and fractional part. In this case, we need only the whole part (in the set task condition we can see, that when the input is equal to 3 the count of ^ in the inner part column is equal to 1, and input of 5 it is 3), we can separate it with the method Math.trunc() and to save only its value in our new variable:\n\n\nIt's always a good practice, whenever we have an expression with the value we intend to use it more than once, to keep it in a variable. In this way, on the one hand, our code will be easier to read, and on the other hand, it will be easier to correct possible errors, as we will not have to look for each use of the expression separately. \n\n\nWe also declare a second variable, which will keep the value of the part between the two towers. By the set task condition, we know that the total width of the fortress is n * 2. In addition, we have two towers with one slash for a start and one slash for an end (a total of 4 characters), and a width of colSize. Therefore, to get the number of characters in the middle part, we have to subtract the size of the towers from the width of the entire fortress: 2 * n - 2 * colSize - 4.\n\nTo print the roof part, on the console we will use the repeat(n) method, which joins a given string n number of times.\n\n\n\\ is a special symbol in JavaScript and using it solely in the method console.log(…), the console will not print it out, so with \\\\ we indicate on the console, that we want to print out exactly this character, without interpreting it as a special character (\"character escaping”).\n\n\nThe fortress body consists of beginning |, middle part (white spaces) and an end |. The middle part of white spaces has a width of 2 * n - 2. The number of rows for the walls can be determined from the given examples: n - 3.\n\nTo draw a penultimate row, which is part of the base, we need to print a beginning |, middle part (white space)_(white space), and an end |. To do this, we can use already declared variables colSize and midSize because as we see from the examples they are equal to the number of _ in the roof.\n\nWe add to the value of white spaces + 1 because in the examples we have one white space more.\nThe structure of the fortress base is the same as the one in the roof. It includes two towers and a middle part. Each tower begins with \\, followed by a middle part _ and an end /.\n\nTesting in The Judge System\nYou can test your solution here: https://judge.softuni.org/Contests/Practice/Index/936#0.\nProblem: Butterfly\nWrite a program, that takes an integer n from the console and draws butterfly with a width of 2 * n - 1 columns and height of 2 * (n - 2) + 1 rows as in the examples below.  The left and the right part have a width of n - 1.\nInput Data\nThe input consists of one element (argument) - integer n in the range [3 … 1000].\nOutput Data\nPrint on the console 2 * (n - 2) + 1  text rows, representing the butterfly, exactly as shown in the examples.\nSample Input and Output\n\n\n\nInput\nOutput\nInput\nOutput\n\n\n\n\n3\n*\\ /*  @  */ \\*\n5\n***\\ /***---\\ /---***\\ /***    @    ***/ \\***---/ \\---***/ \\***\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInput\nOutput\n\n\n\n\n7\n*****\\ /*****-----\\ /-----*****\\ /*****-----\\ /-----*****\\ /*****      @      *****/ \\*****-----/ \\-----*****/ \\*****-----/ \\-----*****/ \\*****\n\n\n\nHints and Guidelines\nSimilar to the previous task, we can see from the condition, that the input data will consist of only one integer in the range [3 … 1000]. We create a function, that receives an array of one element as an argument. Since it's a text (String) type, and we have to work with numbers, we use the Number() method, to convert it to a number type: \n\nWe can divide the figure into 3 parts - upper wing, body, and lower wing. To draw the upper wing of the butterfly, we have to divide it into three parts - a beginning with *, a middle part with \\ /, and an end with *. After looking at the examples, we can say that the upper wing of the butterfly is with a size ofn - 2.\n\nTo draw the upper wing we make a loop repeated halfRowSize number of times:\n\nWe can see in the examples, that on an even row we have a beginning *, middle part \\ / and an end *, on the other hand on an odd row we have a beginning -, middle part \\ / and an end -. Therefore, at each iteration of the loop, we have to do an if-else check to see whether the row that we print is even or odd. From the examples given in the set condition, we can see that the number of star characters and dashes on each row is equal to n - 2, i. e. we can use again the variable halfRowSize to print them. \n\nTo draw the butterfly body, we can use again the variable halfRowSize and print exactly  one row on the console. The structure of the body has a beginning (white space), middle part @, and an end (white space). From the examples, we can see, that the number of the white spaces is equal to n-1. \n\nWhat is left now is to print on the console the lower wing, which is analogical to the upper wing: we only need to swap the places of the slashes.\nTesting in The Judge System\nYou can test your solution here: https://judge.softuni.org/Contests/Practice/Index/936#1.\nProblem: Stop\nWrite a program, that takes an integer n from the console and draws a STOP warning sign with size as shown in the examples below.\nInput Data\nThe input consists of one element (argument) - integer n in the range [3 … 1000].\nOutput Data\nPrint on the console text lines, representing the STOP warning sign, just as in the examples.\nSample Input and Output\n\n\n\nInput\nOutput\nInput\nOutput\n\n\n\n\n3\n...._______.......//_____\\\\.....//_______\\\\...//_________\\\\.//___STOP!___\\\\\\\\___________//.\\\\_________//...\\\\_______//..\n6\n......._____________.............//___________\\\\...........//_____________\\\\.........//_______________\\\\.......//_________________\\\\.....//___________________\\\\...//_____________________\\\\.//_________STOP!_________\\\\\\\\_______________________//.\\\\_____________________//...\\\\___________________//.....\\\\_________________//.......\\\\_______________//.........\\\\\\___________//.....\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInput\nOutput\n\n\n\n\n7\n........_______________...............//_____________\\\\.............//_______________\\\\...........//_________________\\\\.........//___________________\\\\.......//_____________________\\\\.....//_______________________\\\\...//_________________________\\\\.//___________STOP!___________\\\\\\\\___________________________//.\\\\_________________________//...\\\\_______________________//.....\\\\_____________________//.......\\\\___________________//.........\\\\_________________//...........\\\\_______________//......\n\n\n\nHints and Guidelines\nAs in the previous problem, we have to create a function that takes an array of one element, and using the Number() function, we convert it from text (String) type to number type:\n\nWe can divide the figure into three parts - upper, middle, and lower. The upper part consists of two subparts - a starting line and lines in which the sign widens. The starting line consists of beginning ., middle part _, and an end .. After looking at the examples, we can see that the beginning has a size of n + 1 and it's better to keep this value as a separate variable.\n\nWe also have to create a second variable, in which we will keep the value of the first row middle part which has a size of 2 * n + 1.\n\nOnce we have declared and initialized the two variables, we can print the first row on the console.\n\nTo draw the rows in which the sign is getting \"wider\", we have to create a loop, that iterates n number of times. The row structure consists of a beginning ., // + middle part _ + \\\\ and an end .. To reuse the already created variables, we have to decrease dots by 1 and underscores by 2, because we've already printed the first row, and the dots and underscores in the top part of the figure are decreasing on each row.\n\nAt each subsequent iteration the beginning and the end decrease by 1, and the middle part increases by 2.\n\nThe middle part of the figure begins with // + _, middle part STOP! and an end _ + \\\\. The count of the underscores _ is (underscores - 5) / 2.\n\nThe lower part of the figure, in which the width of the sign decreases, can be done by creating a loop, that iterates n number of times. The structure of a row should have a beginning . + \\\\, middle part _ and an end // + .. The number of the dots in the first loop iteration has to be 0 and each subsequent has to increase by one. Therefore we can say that the dots in the lower part of the figure are equal to i.\nTo ensure proper operation of our program, on each loop iteration, we have to decrease the number of _ by 2.\n\nTesting in The Judge System\nYou can test your solution here: https://judge.softuni.org/Contests/Practice/Index/936#2.\nProblem: Arrow\nWrite a program that receives from the console an odd integer n and draws a vertical arrow with size as in the examples below.\nInput Data\nThe input is an odd integer n (argument) within the range [3 … 79].\nOutput Data\nPrint on the console a vertical arrow, in which \"#\" (hash sign) marks the outline of the arrow, and \".\" - the rest.\nSample Input and Output\n\n\n\nInput\nOutput\nInput\nOutput\n\n\n\n\n3\n.###..#.#.##.##.#.#...#..\n5\n..#####....#...#....#...#....#...#..###...###.#.....#...#...#.....#.#.......#....\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInput\nOutput\n\n\n\n\n9\n....#########........#.......#........#.......#........#.......#........#.......#........#.......#........#.......#........#.......#....#####.......#####.#.............#...#...........#.....#.........#.......#.......#.........#.....#...........#...#.............#.#...............#........\n\n\n\nHints and Guidelines\nAs in the previous problem, we have to create a function, that receives an array with one element and using the Number() method, to convert it from text to a number type:\n\nWe can divide the figure into 3 parts - upper, middle, and lower. The upper part consists of two subparts - first row and body of the arrow. We can see from the examples, that the count of  the outer dots in the first row and in the body of the arrow are equal to (n - 1) / 2. We can keep this value in a variable outerDots:\n\nThe count of the inner dots in the body of the arrow is equal to (n - 2). We have to create the variable innerDots, which will keep this value:\n\nWe can see from the examples the structure of the first row. We can use the declared and initialized by us variables outerDots and n, to print the first row:\n\nTo draw the body of the arrow, we have to create a loop, which iterates n - 2 number of times:\n\nThe middle part of the figure is made of a beginning #, middle part . and an end #. The count of # is equal to outerDots + 1:\n\nTo draw the lower part of the arrow, we have to assign new values of the two variables outerDots and innerDots:\n\nOn each loop iteration outerDots increases by 1, and innerDots decreases by 2. We can notice, that on the penultimate row the innerDots value will be 1 and on each subsequent loop iteration will be a negative number. If we use the method str.repeat(count) with a negative number, the program will throw an error. To avoid that we can print the last row of the figure separately.\nThe height of the lower part of the arrow is n - 1, therefore the loop,  that will print all the rows, except the last one, have to iterate n - 2 number of times:\n\nThe last row of our figure is made of a beginning ., middle part #, and an end ..

We can see from the examples what the structure of the first row is and we can create a loop that iterates n number of times. At each loop iteration, the middle dashes are increasing by 1, and the right dashes are decreasing by 1.\n\nNow we have to draw the handle of the axe. To be able to use the newly created variables, when drawing the handle of the axe, we have to decrease the middle dashes by 1 and increase these on the left and right by 1.\n\nThe handle of the axe we can draw, by iterating a loop that repeats n / 2 number of times. We can set this value into a separate variable, considering that when dividing odd number inputs by 2 the result will be a real number with a whole and fractional part. Since in this case, we need only the whole part (from the example condition we see that at input 5 the height of the axe handle is 2), we can use the Math.trunc() method, to save only its value in our new variable.\nWe get the structure of the handle from the examples given:\n\nThe lower part of the figure should be divided into two subparts  - the head of the axe and the last row of the figure. We will print on the console the head of the axe, by making a self iterating loop axeHeight - 1 number of times. On each iteration, the left dashes and the right dashes decrease by 1, and the middle dashes increase by 2.\n\nFor the last row of the figure, we can use again, the already declared variables leftDashes, middleDashes, rightDashes.\n\nTesting in The Judge System\nYou can test your solution here: https://judge.softuni.org/Contests/Practice/Index/936#4.\n"},"chapter-07-complex-loops.html":{"url":"chapter-07-complex-loops.html","title":"7.1.

In particular, we will discuss how to use the following programming constructs:\n\nloops with step\nwhile loops\ndo-while loops\ninfinite loops\n\nIn the current chapter, we will also take a look at the break operator and how to empty it to interrupt a loop.\nLoops with a Step\nIn the \"Loops (Repetitions)\" chapter we learned how the for loop works and we already know when and to what purpose to use it. In the present chapter we will take a look at a particular and a very important part of this structure - its step.\nLoop with a Step – Explanation\nThe step is the part of the for loop, that specifies the amount used to increment or decrement the main variable. The step is declared in the skeleton of the for loop.\nMost often we have a size of 1 and in this case, instead of writing i += 1 or i -= 1, we can use the shorthand operators i++ or i--. In case we need the step to be different than 1 when increasing we use the shorthand i += + required step, and when we decrease i -= + required step. With a step of 3 the loop would appear as below:\n\nHere is a series of sample problems, the solution of which will help us better understand the use of a step in a for loop.\nProblem: Numbers 1...N with Step 3\nWrite a program that prints the numbers from 1 to n with a step of 3. For example, if n = 100, then the output would be: 1, 4, 7, 10, …, 94, 97, 100.\nWe can solve the problem using the following sequence of actions (algorithm):\n\nWe create a function that will take the number n.\nWe run a for loop from 1 to n with a step of 3.\nin the body of the loop, we print the value of the current step.\n\n\nTesting in The Judge System\nYou can test your solution at the following link: https://judge.softuni.org/Contests/Practice/Index/937#0.\nProblem: Numbers N...1\nWrite a program that prints the numbers from n to 1 in reverse (step -1). For example, if n = 100, then the output will be: 100, 99, 98, …, 3, 2, 1.\nWe can solve the problem in the following manner:\n\nWe create a function that will take the number n.\nWe run a for loop, by assigning let i = n.\nWe reverse the condition of the loop: i >= 1.\nWe define the step size: -1.\nin the body of the loop, we print the value of the current step.\n\n\nTesting in The Judge System\nYou can test your solution at the following link: https://judge.softuni.org/Contests/Practice/Index/937#1.\nProblem: Powers of Two\nIn the following example, we will use the standard size 1 step.\nWrite a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 2^n (two to the power of n). For example, if n = 10, then the output would be 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024.\n\nTesting in The Judge System\nYou can test your solution at the following link: https://judge.softuni.org/Contests/Practice/Index/937#2.\nProblem: Even Powers of 2\nPrint the even powers of 2 until 2^n: 2^0, 2^2, 2^4, 2^8, …, 2^n. For example, if n = 10, then the output would be 1, 4, 16, 64, 256, 1024.\nHere is how we can solve the problem:\n\nWe create a function that will take the number n.\nWe declare a variable num that will hold the current number and we assign it the initial value of 1.\nFor the step of the loop, we set a value of 2.\nIn the body of the loop: we print the value of the current number and increase the current number num 4 times (as per the problem description).\n\n\nTesting in The Judge System\nYou can test your solution at the following link: https://judge.softuni.org/Contests/Practice/Index/937#3.\nWhile Loop\nThe next type of loops that we will familiarize are called while loops. The special thing about them is that they repeat a command block while a condition is met. Their structure is a bit different than that of the for loops, however, they boast a simpler syntax.\nWhile Loop – Explanation\nIn programming, the while loop is used when we want to repeat the execution of a specific logic block until a specific condition is met. Any expression that returns either true or false (a Boolean) can be used as a \"condition\". When the condition becomes invalid, the while loop is interrupted and the program proceeds to execute the code after the loop. The while loop structure looks like this:\n\nHere is a series of sample problems, the solutions of which will help us better understand the use of the while loop.\nProblem: Sequence 2k+1\nWrite a program that prints all numbers ≤ n in the series: 1, 3, 7, 15, 31, …, assuming that each number is generated according to the following formula nextNumber = previousNumber * 2 + 1.\nHere is how we can solve the problem:\n\nWe create a function that will take the number n.\nWe declare a variable num that will hold the current number and we assign it the initial value of 1.\nFor loop condition, we use the current number .\nin the body of the loop: we print the value of the current number and increase the current number by using the formula above.\n\nHere is a sample implementation of this idea:\n\nTesting in The Judge System\nYou can test your solution here: https://judge.softuni.org/Contests/Practice/Index/937#4.\nProblem: Number in Range [1...100]\nEnter an integer in the range [1 … 100]. If the entered number is invalid, enter another. In this case, an invalid number would be any number that is outside the given range.\nTo solve the problem, we can use the following algorithm:\n\nWe declare variable i, to which we assign the initial value of 0. Through which we save the position of each argument passed to our function.\nWe declare a variable num, to which we assign the integer part of the first argument, passed to the function.\nFor a loop condition, we put a true expression, if the number is not in the range specified in the problem description.\nOn the body of the loop: we increment i so that at the next loop cycle we can take the next number passed to our function. We print the message \"Invalid number!\" on the console, afterwards we assign a new value to num (the next argument, passed to our function).\nOnce we have validated the entered number, we print its value outside the body of the loop.\n\nHere is a sample implementation of the algorithm using a while loop:\n\nTesting in The Judge System\nYou can test your solution here: https://judge.softuni.org/Contests/Practice/Index/937#5.\nGreatest Common Divisor (GCD)\nBefore proceeding to the next problem, we should become familiar with the definition of the greatest common divisor (GCD).\nDefinition of GCD: the greatest common divisor of two natural numbers a and b is the largest number that divides both a and b without reminder. For example:\n\n\n\na\nb\nGCD\n\n\n\n\n24\n16\n8\n\n\n67\n18\n1\n\n\n12\n24\n12\n\n\n15\n9\n3\n\n\n10\n10\n10\n\n\n100\n88\n4\n\n\n\nThe Euclidean Algorithm\nIn the next problem we will use one of the first published algorithms for finding the GCD – Euclid's algorithm:\nUntil we have a remainder of 0:\n\nWe divide the greater number by the smaller one.\nWe take the remainder of the division.\n\nEuclid's algorithm pseudo-code:\nwhile b ≠ 0\n  var oldB = b;\n  b = a % b;\n  a = oldB;\nprint a;\n\nProblem: Greatest Common Divisor (GCD)\nEnter the integers a and b and find GCD(a, b).\nWe will solve the problem by implementing Euclid's algorithm:\n\nWe declare variables a and b, to which we assign the integer values, passed to our function.\nFor loop condition, we use a true expression, if the number b is different than 0.\nIn the body of the loop we follow the instructions from the pseudo-code:\nWe create a temporary variable to which we assign the current value of b.\nWe assign a new value to b, which is the remainder of the division of a and b.\nOn variable a we assign the previous value of the variable b.\n\n\nOnce the loop is complete and we have found the GCD, we print it on the screen.\n\n\nTesting in The Judge System\nYou can test your solution here: https://judge.softuni.org/Contests/Practice/Index/937#6.\nDo-While Loop\nThe next type of loop we will study is the do-while loop. By structure it resembles the while, but with a significant difference. The do-while will execute its body at least once. Why is this? In the do-while loop structure, the condition is always checked after the body, which ensures that the first loop iteration will execute the code and the check for the end of the loop will be applied to each subsequent iteration of the do-while.\n\nNow we should proceed with the usual set of practical problems, that will help us better understand the do-while loop.\nProblem: Factorial\nFor natural n number, calculate n! = 1 * 2 * 3 * … * n. For example, if n = 5, then the result would be: 5! = 1 * 2 * 3 * 4 * 5 = 120.\nHere is how we can calculate factorial in more detail:\n\nWe declare the variable n, to which we assign the integer value, passed to our function.\nWe declare another variable - fact, with an initial value of 1. We will use it in the calculation and store the factorial value.\nFor the loop condition we will use n > 1, because each time we perform the calculations in the body of the loop, we will decrease the value of n by 1.\nIn the body of the loop:\nWe assign a new value to fact, which value is the product of multiplying the current fact with the current n.\nWe decrement n with 1.\n\n\nOutside the body of the loop, we print the final factorial value.\n\n\nTesting in The Judge System\nTest your solution here: https://judge.softuni.org/Contests/Practice/Index/937#7.\nProblem: Sum Digits\nSum up the digits of the integer positive number n. For example if n = 5634, then the output would be: 5 + 6 + 3 + 4 = 18.\nWe can use the following idea to solve the problem:\n\nWe declare the variable n, to which we assign a value equal to the number passed to our function.\nWe create a second variable - sum, with an initial value of 0. We will use it for the calculation and storage of the result.\nAs a loop condition, we will use n > 0, since, after each iteration of the loop, we will be removing the last digit from n.\nIn the body of the loop:\nWe assign a new value to sum, which is the result of the sum of the current value of sum with the last digit of n.\nWe assign a new value to n, which is the result of removing the last digit of n.\n\n\nOutside the body of the loop, we print the final value of the sum.\n\n\n\nn % 10: returns the last digit of the number n.\nMath.floor(n / 10): deletes the last digit of n.\n\n\nTesting in The Judge System\nTest your solution here: https://judge.softuni.org/Contests/Practice/Index/937#8.\nInfinite Loops and The break Operator\nSo far, we were introduced to various types of loops, learning what structures they have and how they are applied. Now, we need to understand what an infinite loop is, when it occurs, and how we can break it using the break operator.\nInfinite Loop – Explanation\nAn infinite loop runs infinitely the execution of its body. With while and do-while loops the end check is a conditional expression that always returns true. Infinite for occurs when there is no condition to end the loop.\nHere is an example of an infinite while loop:\n\nAnd here is an infinite for loop:\n\nThe break Operator\nWe already know that the infinite loop executes a certain code infinitely, but what if we want at some point under a given condition to interrupt and exit the loop? The break operator comes in handy in this situation.\n\nThe operator break stops a loop's execution at the point it is called and the execution continues from the first line after the end of the loop. This means that the current iteration of the loop will not be completed accordingly and the rest of the code in the body of the loop will not be executed.\n\n\nProblem: Check Prime\nThe next problem we are going to solve is to check whether a given number is prime, but before that, we should remember what are prime numbers.\nDefinition: An integer is considered prime if it is divisible only by itself and by 1. By definition, the prime numbers are positive and greater than 1. The smallest prime number is 2.\nWe can assume that an integer n is a prime number if n > 1 and n is not divisible by a number between 2 and n-1.\nThe first few prime numbers are: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, …\nBy contrast, composite numbers are integers, which can be obtained by multiplying several prime numbers.\nHere are some examples of composite numbers:\n\n10 = 2 * 5\n42 = 2  3  7\n143 = 13 * 11\n\nAn algorithm to check whether a given number is prime: we check if n > 1 and if n is divisible by 2, 3, …, n-1 without remainder.\n\nIf it is divisible by any of the numbers, it is composite.\nIf it is not divisible by any of the numbers, then it is prime.\n\n\nWe can optimize the algorithm by instead of checking until n-1, checking divisors only until √n. Think of the reasons why this is so.\n\n\nProblem: Enter Even Number\nYou are tasked to write a function that takes a single input n integer and checks if it is prime. This can be implemented by checking if n is divisible by any numbers in the range between 2 and √n.\nThe steps of the \"prime checking algorithm\" are given below in bigger detail:\n\nWe declare the variable n, to which we assign the integer passed to our function.\nWe create a prime boolean with, and an initial value of true. We assume that a number is prime until proven otherwise.\nWe create a for loop, with the initial value set to 2, for a condition the current value . The step is set to 1.\nIn the body of the loop, we check if n, divided by the current value has a remainder. If there is no reminder from the division, then we change prime to false and exit the loop through the break operator.\nDepending on the value of prime we print whether the input number is prime (true) or composite (false).\n\nHere is a sample implementation of the prime checking algorithm, described above:\n\nWhat remains is to add a condition that checks if the input number is greater than 1, because, by definition numbers such as 0, 1, -1, and -2 are not prime.\nTesting in The Judge System\nTest your solution here: https://judge.softuni.org/Contests/Practice/Index/937#9.\nProblem: Break Sum\nWrite a function, which checks whether a given number n is even and if so - print it on the console. An even number can be divided by 2 without a remainder. If the number is invalid, we will print that the current number is not even and the user will need to input a new number.\nHere is an idea for the solution:\n\nWe declare the variable i, which shall hold the initial value of 0. Through it, we will store the position of every number passed to our function.\nWe declare a variable num, with an initial value of 0.\nWe create an infinite while loop with a condition set to true.\nIn the body of the loop:\nWe take the integer value, passed to our function, and assign it to num.\nIf the number is even, we exit the loop by a break.\nOtherwise, we print a message stating that the number is not even. We increment i so that we can take the next number from the input on the next iteration. The iterations continue until an even number is entered.\n\n\nWe print the even number on the console.\n\nHere is an example implementation of the idea:\n\nTesting in The Judge System\nTest your solution here: https://judge.softuni.org/Contests/Practice/Index/937#10.\nNested Loops and The break Operator\nNow since we know what the nested loops are and how the break operator works, it is time to figure out how they work together. To get a better idea, we should write a function step by step, that should make all possible combinations of number pairs. The first number in the pair is increasing from 1 to 3, while the second one is decreasing from 3 to 1. Our solution must continue running until i + j is not equal to 2 (i.e. i = 1 and j = 1).\nThe desired result is:\n\nHere is a wrong implementation, that looks right at first glance:\n\nIf we leave our function that way, our result will be as follows:\n\nWhy is this so? As we can see, the result is missing \"1 1\". When the function reaches the point when i = 1 and j = 1, it enters the if check and executes the break operation. This way, it exits the inner loop, but then continues the execution of the outer loop. i increases, the function enters the inner loop and prints the result.\n\nWhen we use the break operator in a nested loop, it interrupts only the execution of the inner loop.\n\n\nWhat is the correct solution? One way to solve the problem is by declaring a bool variable, to keep track if the loop iteration has to continue. If we have to exit (leave all nested loops), we set the variable to true and exit the inner loop with break and in the next check, we exit the outer loop. Here is an example implementation of this idea:\n\nIn this manner, when i + j = 2, the program will set the variable hasToEnd = true and will exit the inner loop. Upon the next iteration of the outer loop, via the if check, the function will not reach the inner loop and will interrupt its execution.\nTesting in The Judge System\nTest your solution here: https://judge.softuni.org/Contests/Practice/Index/937#11.\nExercises with loops\nIn this chapter, we got familiar with a few new types of loops that can perform repetitions with more complex programming logic. Let's solve a few practical problems using these new constructs.\nProblem: Fibonacci\nFibonacci's numbers in mathematics form a sequence that looks like this: 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, ….\nThe formula to derive the next member of Fibonacci's sequence is:\nF0 = 1\nF1 = 1\nFn = Fn-1 + Fn-2\n\nSample Input and Output\n\n\n\nInput (n)\nOutput\nComment\n\n\n\n\n10\n89\nF(11) = F(9) + F(8)\n\n\n5\n8\nF(5) = F(4) + F(3)\n\n\n20\n10946\nF(20) = F(19) + F(18)\n\n\n0\n1\n\n\n\n1\n1\n\n\n\nEnter an integer number n and calculate the n-th Fibonacci number.\nHints and Guidelines\nAn idea to solve the problem:\n\nWe declare a variable n, which will hold the integer value passed to our function.\nWe create the variables f0 and f1, to which we assign the value to 1 since this is the start of Fibonacci's sequence.\nWe create a for loop with condition current value i .\nIn the body of the loop:\nWe create a temporary variable fNext, to which we assign the next number in the Fibonacci sequence.\nTo f0 we assign the current value of f1.\nTo f1 we assign the value of the temporary variable fNext.\n\n\nOut of the loop we print the n-th number of Fibonacci.\n\nExample implementation:\n\nTesting in The Judge System\nTest your solution here: https://judge.softuni.org/Contests/Practice/Index/937#12.\nProblem: Number Pyramid\nPrint the numbers 1 … n in a pyramid as per the below example. On the first row, we print one number, at the second we print two, at the third, we print three, and so on, until the numbers are over. On the last line, we print as many numbers as we get until we get to n.\nSample Input and Output\n\n\n\nInput\nOutput\nInput\nOutput\nInput\nOutput\n\n\n\n\n7\n12 34 5 67\n5\n12 34 5\n10\n12 34 5 67 8 9 10\n\n\n\nHints and Guidelines\nWe can solve the problem with two nested loops (by rows and columns) by printing in them and leaving when the last number is reached. Here is the idea, written in more detail:\n\nWe declare a variable n, to which we assign the integer value passed to our function.\nWe declare a variable num with an initial value of 1. It will hold the count of printed numbers. At each iteration, we will increment it by 1 and will add it to the current row.\nWe declare a variable result, which will hold the current row and to which we will add the value of the current cell.\nWe create an outer for loop, which will be responsible for the rows in the table. The loop variable will be named row and we assign it an initial value of 1. For condition, we set row . The step will also be 1.\nIn the body of the loop, we create an inner for loop, which will be responsible for the columns in the table. We name the variable col and assign it an initial value of 1. For condition we set col  (row = number of digits per line). The step will also be 1.\nIn the body of the nested loop:\nWe check whether col > 1, if true we add a space to the variable result. If we do not make this check and instead add the space every time, each resulting line will start with a space.\nWe store the number num in the current cell of the table and increment it by 1.\nWe check if num > n. If the num is greater than n, we interrupt the inner loop.\n\n\nWe print the value of the variable result and after that, we set it to an empty value. This way we can proceed to the next line.\nAgain, we check if num > n. If it is greater, we interrupt the execution of our function with a break.\n\nHere is an example implementation:\n\nTesting in The Judge System\nTest your solution here: https://judge.softuni.org/Contests/Practice/Index/937#13.\nProblem: Number Table\nPrint the numbers 1 … n in a table as per the examples below:\nSample Input and Output\n\n\n\nInput\nOutput\nInput\nOutput\n\n\n\n\n3\n1 2 32 3 23 2 1\n4\n1 2 3 42 3 4 33 4 3 24 3 2 1\n\n\n\nHints and Guidelines\nWe can solve the problem by using two nested loops and some simple calculations in them:\n\nWe take the size of the table from the integer value of the variable n, which is passed to our function.\nWe declare the variable result, which will hold the current row and to which we will add the value of the current cell.\nWe create a for loop, that will be responsible for the rows of the table. We name the loop variable row and assign it an initial value of 0. For condition, we set row . The size of the step is 1.\nIn the body of the loop we create a nested for loop, that will be responsible for the columns in the table. We name the loop variable col and assign it an initial value of 0. For condition, we set col . The size of the step is set to 1.\nIn the body of the nested loop:\nWe create a variable num, to which we assign the result of the current row + the current column + 1 (+1 is needed since we count from 0).\nWe check whether num > n. If num is greater than n, we assign num a new value equal to two times n - the current value of num. We do this in order not to exceed n** in any of the cells of the table.\nWe add the number of the current cell to the variable result.\n\n\nWe print the value of the result, after which we set it to a new empty value. This way we can proceed to the next line.\n\n\nTesting in The Judge System\nTest your solution here: https://judge.softuni.org/Contests/Practice/Index/937#14.\nWhat Have We Learned from This Chapter?\nWe can use for loops with a step:\nfor (let i = 1; i \nThe while / do-while loops are repeated while a condition is true:\nlet num = 1;\nwhile (num \nIf we have to interrupt the loop execution, we use the break operator:\nlet n = 0;\nwhile (true) {\n   n = parseInt(arg1);\n   if (n % 2 === 0) {\n      break; // even number -> exit from the loop\n   }\n   console.log(\"The number is not even.\");\n}\nconsole.log(`Even number entered: ${num}`);\n\n"},"chapter-07-complex-loops-exam-problems.html":{"url":"chapter-07-complex-loops-exam-problems.html","title":"7.2.

Follow the steps and try to solve the problem on your own:\n\nInitialize the variable where you will store the magic number.\nNest six for loops, one for each digit.\nIn the last loop, using an if statement, check if the product of the six digits is equal to the magic number.\n\n\nIn the previous chapter, we reviewed other loop constructions. Let's look at the sample solution of the same problem using the while loop.\nFirst, we need to store the input magical number in a suitable variable. Then we will initialize 6 variables – one for each of the six digits of the searched numbers. \n\nThen we will start writing while loops.\n\nWe will initialize first digit: d1 = 1.\nWe will set a condition for each loop: the digit will be less than or equal to 10.\nAt the beginning of each loop, we set a value of the next digit, in this case: d2 = 1. In the nested for loops, we initialize the variables in the inner loops at each increment of the outer ones. We want to do the same here.\nAt the end of each loop, we will increase the digit by one: d++.\nIn the innermost loop, we will make the check and if necessary, we add the result into the variable, that stores the solution.\n\n\nAs we can see, we can solve a problem using different types of loops. Of course, each task has its most appropriate choice. To practice each type of loop – try to solve each of the following problems with all the learned loops.\nTesting in The Judge System\nTest your solution here: https://judge.softuni.org/Contests/Practice/Index/938#1.\nProblem: Stop Number\nWrite a program that prints on the console all numbers from N to M, that are divisible by 2 and 3 without remainder, in reversed order. We will read one more \"stop\" number from the console – S. If any of the numbers divisible by 2 and 3 is equal to the stop number, it should not be printed, and the program should end. Otherwise print all numbers up to N, that meet the condition.\nInput Data\nRead from the console 3 numbers, each on a single line:\n\nN – integer number: 0 ≤ N .\nM – integer number: N .\nS – integer number: N ≤ S ≤ M.\n\nOutput Data\nPrint on the console on a single line all numbers, that meet the condition, separated by space. \nSample Input and Output\n\n\n\nInput\nOutput\nComments\n\n\n\n\n13015\n30 24 18 12 6\nNumbers from 30 to 1, that are divisible at the same time by 2 and 3 without remainder are: 30, 24, 18, 12 and 6.

It is a bit tricky – the explanation mentions that the numbers have to be printed in reversed order. This means that the initial value of the variable i will be bigger, and from the examples, we can see that it is M. Thus, the final value of i should be N. The fact that we will print the results in reversed order and the values of i, suggests that the step would be decreased by 1.\n\nAfter we have initialized the for loop, it is time for the third part of the problem – checking the condition if the given number is divisible both by 2 and 3 without remainder. We will do this using one simple if condition that we will leave to the reader to do by themselves.\nAnother tricky part of this problem is that apart from the above check we need to do another one – whether the number is equal to the \"stop\" number entered from the console on the third line. To do this check, the previous one has to be passed. For this reason, we will add another if statement that we will nest in the previous one. If the condition is true, we need to stop the program from printing. We can do this using a break operator, and it will lead us out of the for loop.\nIf the condition that checks whether the number is equal with the \"stop\" number returns a false result, our program should continue to print. This covers the fourth and last part of our program.\nTesting in The Judge System\nTest your solution here: https://judge.softuni.org/Contests/Practice/Index/938#2.\nProblem: Special Numbers\nWrite a program that reads one integer number N and generates all possible special numbers from 1111 to 9999. To be considered special, a number must correspond to the following condition:\n\nN to be divisible by each of its digits without remainder.\n\nExample: upon N = 16, 2418 is a special number:\n\n16 / 2 = 8 without remainder\n16 / 4 = 4 without remainder\n16 / 1 = 16 without remainder\n16 / 8 = 2 without remainder\n\nInput Data\nThe input is read from the program and consists of one integer (argument) within the range [1 … 600 000].\nOutput Data\nPrint on the console all special numbers, separated by space.\nSample Input and Output\n\n\n\nInput\nOutput\nComments\n\n\n\n\n3\n1111 1113 1131 1133 1311 1313 1331 1333 3111 3113 3131 3133 3311 3313 3331 3333\n3 / 1 = 3 without remainder3 / 3 = 1 without remainder3 / 3 = 1 without remainder3 / 3 = 1 without remainder\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInput\nOutput\nInput\nOutput\n\n\n\n\n11\n1111\n16\n1111 1112 1114 1118 1121 1122 1124 1128 1141 1142 1144 1148 1181 1182 1184 1188 1211 1212 1214 1218 1221 1222 1224 1228 1241 1242 1244 1248 1281 1282 1284 1288 1411 1412 1414 1418 1421 1422 1424 1428 1441 1442 1444 1448 1481 1482 1484 1488 1811 1812 1814 1818 1821 1822 1824 1828 1841 1842 1844 1848 1881 1882 1884 1888 2111 2112 2114 2118 2121 2122 2124 2128 2141 2142 2144 2148 2181 2182 2184 2188 2211 2212 2214 2218 2221 2222 2224 2228 2241 2242 2244 2248 2281 2282 2284 2288 2411 2412 2414 2418 2421 2422 2424 2428 2441 2442 2444 2448 2481 2482 2484 2488 2811 2812 2814 2818 2821 2822 2824 2828 2841 2842 2844 2848 2881 2882 2884 2888 4111 4112 4114 4118 4121 4122 4124 4128 4141 4142 4144 4148 4181 4182 4184 4188 4211 4212 4214 4218 4221 4222 4224 4228 4241 4242 4244 4248 4281 4282 4284 4288 4411 4412 4414 4418 4421 4422 4424 4428 4441 4442 4444 4448 4481 4482 4484 4488 4811 4812 4814 4818 4821 4822 4824 4828 4841 4842 4844 4848 4881 4882 4884 4888 8111 8112 8114 8118 8121 8122 8124 8128 8141 8142 8144 8148 8181 8182 8184 8188 8211 8212 8214 8218 8221 8222 8224 8228 8241 8242 8244 8248 8281 8282 8284 8288 8411 8412 8414 8418 8421 8422 8424 8428 8441 8442 8444 8448 8481 8482 8484 8488 8811 8812 8814 8818 8821 8822 8824 8828 8841 8842 8844 8848 8881 8882 8884 8888\n\n\n\nHints and Guidelines\nSolve the problem by yourself using what you learned from the previous two problems.

Practical Exam Preparation - Part I\nIn the present chapter, we will examine a few problems with a level of difficulty that can be expected in the problems of the practical exam. We will review and practice all the knowledge that was gained from this book.\nThe Practical Exam\nThere are 6 problems included, and you will have 4 hours to solve them. Each of the exam problems will cover one of the studied topics during the course. Problem topics are as follows:\n\nProblem with simple calculations (without conditions)\nProblem with simple condition\nProblem with more complex conditions\nProblem with a simple loop\nProblem with nested loops (drawing a figure on the console)\nProblem with nested loops and more complex logic\n\nThe Online Evaluation System (Judge)\nAll exams and homework are automatically tested through the online Judge system: https://judge.softuni.org. For each of the problems, there are visible (zero points) tests that help you understand what is expected of the problem and fix your mistakes, as well as competition tests that are hidden and check if your solution is working properly.\nHow does the testing in the Judge system work? You upload the source code and from the menu below you choose to compile as a JavaScript program. The program is being tested with a series of tests, giving points for each successful test.\nProblems with Simple Calculations\nThe first problem of the practical exam covers simple calculations without checks and loops. Here are a few examples:\nProblem: Triangle Area\n\n   \n      \n        Triangle in the plain  is defined by the coordinates of its three vertices. First, the vertex (x1, y1) is set. Then the other two vertices are set: (x2, y2) and (x3, y3) which lie on a common horizontal line i.e. they have the same Y coordinates). Write a program that calculates the triangle area by the coordinates of its three vertices.\n      \n      \n         \n      \n   \n\n\nInput Data\nWe submit 6 integers as parameters of the function: x1, y1, x2, y2, x3, y3.\n\nAll input numbers are in the range [-1000 … 1000].\nIt's guaranteed that y2 = y3.\n\nOutput Data\nPrint on the console the triangle area.\nSample Input and Output\n\n\n\nInput\nOutput\nVisualization\nComments\n\n\n\n\n5-26111\n7.5\n\nThe side of the triangle a = 6 - 1 = 5The height of the triangle h = 1 - (-2) = 3The area of the triangle S = a * h / 2 = 5 * 3 / 2 = 7.5\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInput\nOutput\nVisualization\nComments\n\n\n\n\n41-1-33-3\n8\n\nThe side of the triangle a = 3 - (-1) = 4The height of the triangle h = 1 - (-3) = 4The area of the triangle S = a * h / 2 = 4 * 4 / 2 = 8\n\n\n\nHints and Guidelines\nIt is important in such types of tasks where some coordinates are given to pay attention to the order in which they are submitted and to properly understand which of the coordinates we will use and how. In this case, the input is in order x1, y1, x2, y2, x3, y3. If we do not follow this sequence, the solution becomes wrong. First, we write the code that reads the input data:\n\nWe have to calculate the side and the height of the triangle. From the examples and the condition y2 = y3 we notice that one side is always parallel to the horizontal axis. It means that its length is equal to the length of the segment between its coordinates x2 and x3,  which is equal to the difference between the larger and the smaller coordinates. Similarly, we can calculate the height. It will always be equal to the difference between y1 and y2(or y3,  as they are equal). Since we do not know if x2 is greater than x3, or y1 will be below or above the triangle side, we will use the absolute values of the difference to always get positive numbers because one segment cannot have a negative length.\n\nWe will calculate the triangle area by using our familiar formula for finding an area of a triangle.\n\nThe only thing left is to print the area on the console.\n\nTesting in The Judge System\nTest your solution here: https://judge.softuni.org/Contests/Practice/Index/939#0.\nProblem: Bricks\nConstruction workers have to transfer a total of x bricks.

To transport 355 bricks, exactly 12 courses are needed: 11 complete courses carry 330 bricks and the last 12th course carries the last 25 bricks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInput\nOutput\nComments\n\n\n\n\n51230\n1\nWe have 5 workers, each transporting 30 bricks per course. In total, workers are transporting 150 bricks per course. To transport 5 bricks, only 1 course is enough (although incomplete, with only 5 bricks).\n\n\n\nHints and Guidelines\nThe input is standard, and we only need to be careful about the sequence in which we read the data. \n\nWe calculate how many bricks the workers transport in a single course.\n\nBy dividing the total number of bricks transported for 1 course, we will obtain the number of courses needed to carry them. We will use the method Math.ceil(…) to round the result always up. When the bricks can be transferred with an exact number of courses, the division will return a whole number and there will be nothing to round. Accordingly, if not, the result of the division will be the number of exact courses but with a decimal fraction.  The decimal part will be rounded up and we will get the required 1 course for the remaining bricks.\n\nIn the end, we print the result on the console.\n\nTesting in The Judge System\nTest your solution here: https://judge.softuni.org/Contests/Practice/Index/939#1.\nProblems with Simple Condition\nThe second problem of the Practical Exam covers conditional statements and simple calculations. Here are a few examples:\nProblem: Point on a Segment\nA horizontal segment is placed on a horizontal line, set with the x coordinates of both ends: first and second. A point is located on the same horizontal line and is set with its x coordinate. Write a program that checks whether the point is inside or outside of the segment and calculates the distance to the nearest end of the segment.\nInput Data\nAs parameters of the function we give 3 integers:\n\nThe first number – the one end of the segment.\nThe second number – the other end of the segment.\nThe point number – the location of the point.\n\nAll inputs are integers in the range [-1000 … 1000].\nOutput Data\nPrint the result on the console:\n\nOn the first line, print \"in\" or \"out\" – whether the point is inside or outside the segment.\nOn the second line, print the distance from the point to the nearest end of the segment.\n\nSample Input and Output\n\n\n\nInput\nOutput\nVisualization\n\n\n\n\n1057\nin2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInput\nOutput\nVisualization\n\n\n\n\n8105\nout3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInput\nOutput\nVisualization\n\n\n\n\n1-23\nout2\n\n\n\n\nHints and Guidelines\nWe read the input from the console.\n\nSince we do not know which point  is on the left and which is on the right, we will create two variables to mark this. Since the left point is always the one with the smaller x coordinate, we will use Math.min(…) to find it. Accordingly, the right point is always the one with a larger x coordinate and we will use Math.max(…). We will also find the distance from the point x to the two points. Because we do not know their position relative to each other, we will use Math.abs(…) to get a positive result.\n\nThe shorter of the two distances we will find by using Math.min(…).\n\nWhat remains is to find whether the point is on or out of the line. The point will be on the lines always when it matches one of the other two points or its x coordinate lies between them. Otherwise, the point is outside the line.  After checking, we display one of the two messages, depending on which condition is satisfied.\n\nFinally, we print the distance which we fine before.\n\nTesting in The Judge System\nTest your solution here: https://judge.softuni.org/Contests/Practice/Index/939#2.\nProblem: Point in Figure\nWrite a program that checks if a point (with coordinates x and y) is inside or outside of the given figure:\n\nInput Data\nAs parameters of the function, we give two integers: x and y.\nAll inputs are integers in the range [-1000 … 1000].\nOutput Data\nPrint on the console \"in\" or \"out\" – whether the point is inside or outside the figure (the outline is inside).\nSample Input and Output\n\n\n\nInput\nOutput\nInput\nOutput\n\n\n\n\n8-5\nin\n6-3\nin\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInput\nOutput\nInput\nOutput\n\n\n\n\n11-5\nout\n112\nout\n\n\n\nHints and Guidelines\nTo find out if the point is inside of the figure, we will divide the figure into 2 rectangles:\n\n\nA sufficient condition is a point to be located in one of them, to be in the figure.\nWe read the input from the console:\n\nWe will initialize two variables that will mark whether the point is in one of the rectangles.\n\nWhen printing the message, we will check whether any of the variables has accepted a value of true. It's enough only one of them to be true  so that the point is in the figure.\n\nTesting in The Judge System\nTest your solution here: https://judge.softuni.org/Contests/Practice/Index/939#3.\nProblems with Complex Conditions\nThe third problem of the Practical Exam includes several nested checks combined with simple calculations. Here are a few examples:\nProblem: Date After 5 Days\nThere are two numbers d (day) and m (month) that form a date. Write a program that prints the date that will be after 5 days. For example, 5 days after 28.03 is the date 2.04. We assume that the months: April, June, September, and November have 30 days, February has 28 days, and the rest have 31 days. Months to be printed with leading zero when they contain a single digit (e.g. 01, 08).\nInput Data\nAs parameters of the function we give two integers:\n\nAn integer d in the range [1 … 31] – day. The number of the day does not exceed the number of days in that month (e.g. 28 for February).\nAn integer m in the range [1 … 12] – month. Month 1 is January, month 2 is February, …, month 12 is December. The month may contain a leading zero (e.g. April may be written as 4 or 04).\n\nOutput Data\nPrint a single line containing the date after 5 days in the format day.month on the console. The month must be a 2-digit number with a leading zero, if necessary. The day must be written without leading zero.\nSample Input and Output\n\n\n\nInput\nOutput\nInput\nOutput\n\n\n\n\n2803\n2.04\n2712\n1.01\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInput\nOutput\nInput\nOutput\n\n\n\n\n251\n30.01\n2602\n3.03\n\n\n\nHints and Guidelines\nWe take the input from the console.\n\nTo make our checks easier, we'll create a variable that will contain the number of days that we have in the month we set.\n\nWe are increasing the day with 5.\n\nWe check if the day has not exceeded the number of days in the month. If so, we must deduct the days of the month from the obtained day to calculate which day of the next month our day corresponds to.\n\nAfter we have passed to the next month,  this should be noted by increasing the initial one by 1. We need to check if it has not become greater than 12 and if it has, to adjust it. Because we cannot skip more than one month when we increase by 5 days, the following check is enough.\n\nThe only thing that remains is to print the result on the console. It is important to format the output correctly to display the leading zero in the first 9 months. This is done by creating a new variable for the month, to which to add 0 if necessary. Finally, we print the day and the new variable for the month.\n\nTesting in The Judge System\nTest your solution here: https://judge.softuni.org/Contests/Practice/Index/939#4.\nProblem: Sums 3 Numbers\nThere are 3 integers given. Write a program that checks if the sum of two of the numbers is equal to the third one. For example, if the numbers are 3, 5, and 2, the sum of two of the numbers is equal to the third one: 2 + 3 = 5.\nInput Data\nAs parameters of the function, we give three integers. The numbers are in the range [1 … 1000].\nOutput Data\n\nPrint a text line on the console containing the solution of the problem in the format \"a + b = c\", where a, b and c are among the three input numbers and  a ≤ b.\nIf the problem has no solution, print “No” on the console.\n\nSample Input and Output\n\n\n\nInput\nOutput\nInput\nOutput\n\n\n\n\n352\n2 + 3 = 5\n224\n2 + 2 = 4\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInput\nOutput\nInput\nOutput\n\n\n\n\n115\nNo\n263\nNo\n\n\n\nHints and Guidelines\nWe take the input from the console.\n\nWe have to check if the sum of a pair of numbers is equal to the third number. We have three possible cases:\n\na + b = c\na + c = b \nb + c = a\n\nWe will write a template, which will later be complemented by the required code. If none of the above three conditions is met, we will make our program print \"No\".\n\nWe now have to understand the order in which the two addends will be written in the output of the program. For this purpose, we will create a nested condition that checks which one of the two numbers is the larger one. In the first case, it will look like this:\n\nSimilarly, we will supplement the other two cases. The full code of the program will look like this:\n\nTesting in The Judge System\nTest your solution here: https://judge.softuni.org/Contests/Practice/Index/939#5.\nProblems with Simple Loops\nThe fourth problem of the Practical Exam includes a simple loop with simple logic in it. Here are a few examples:\nProblem: Sums Step 3\nThere are given n integers a1, a2, …, an. Calculate the sums:\n\nsum1 = a1 + a4 + a7 + … (the numbers are summed, starting from the first one with step of 3).\nsum2 = a2 + a5 + a8 + … (the numbers are summed, starting from the second one with step of 3).\nsum3 = a3 + a6 + a9 + … (the numbers are summed, starting from the third one with step of 3).\n\nInput Data\nAs an input of our function, we give the array with size n+1 (0 ≤ n ≤ 1000). The array will contain the number of the numbers n and n integers in the range [-1000 … 1000]: a1, a2, …, an.\nOutput Data\nOn the console, we should print 3 lines containing the 3 sums in a format such as in the example.\nSample Input and Output\n\n\n\nInput\nOutput\nInput\nOutput\nInput\nOutput\n\n\n\n\n235\nsum1 = 3sum2 = 5sum3 = 0\n47-2612\nsum1 = 19sum2 = -2sum3 = 6\n535278\nsum1 = 10sum2 = 13sum3 = 2\n\n\n\nHints and Guidelines\nWe will take the count of numbers (the size of the input array) and will declare starting values of the three sums.\n\nSince we do not know in advance how many numbers we will process, we will take them one at a time in a loop which will be repeated n times and we will process them in the body of the loop.\n\nTo find out which of the three sums we need to add the number, we will divide its sequence number into three and we will use the remainder. We'll use the variable i which tracks the number of runs of the loop, to find out which sequence number we are at. When the remainder of i/3 is zero, it means we will add this number to the first sum, when it's 1 to the second, and when it's 2 to the third.\n\nFinally, we will print the result on the console in the required format.\n\nTesting in The Judge System\nTest your solution here: https://judge.softuni.org/Contests/Practice/Index/939#6.\nProblem: Increasing Elements\nA series of n numbers is given: a1, a2, …, an. Calculate the length of the longest increasing sequence of consecutive elements in the series of numbers.\nInput Data\nWe give an array with size n+1 (0 ≤ n ≤ 1000) as a parameter of the function. The array will contain the count of the numbers n and n integers in the range [-1000 … 1000]: a1, a2, …, an.\nOutput Data\nPrint on the console one number – the length of the longest increasing sequence.\nSample Input and Output\n\n\n\nInput\nOutput\nInput\nOutput\nInput\nOutput\nInput\nOutput\n\n\n\n\n3524\n2\n42876\n2\n41244\n3\n45678\n4\n\n\n\nHints and Guidelines\nTo solve this problem, we need to think in a bit more algorithmic way. A sequence of numbers is given to us, and we need to check whether each subsequent one will be larger than the previous one and if so, we count how long is the sequence in which this condition is fulfilled. Then we have to find which sequence of these is the longest one. To do this, let's create some variables that we will use during solving the problem.\n\nThe variable n is the count of numbers we get from the console. In countCurrentLongest we'll keep the number of elements in the increasing sequence we are currently counting. For example, in the sequence: 5, 6, 1, 2, 3 countCurrentLongest will be 2 when we reach the second element of the counting (5, 6, 1, 2, 3) and will become 3 when we reach the last element (5, 6, 1, 2, 3) because the increasing row 1, 2, 3 has 3 elements. We will use countLongest to keep the longest increasing sequence. The other variables are num - the number we are currently in and numPrev - the previous number which we will compare with num to see if the row is growing.\nWe begin to run the numbers and check if the present number a s larger than the previous numPrev. If this is true, then the row is growing, and we need to increase its number by 1. This is stored in the variable that tracks the length of the sequence we are currently in – countCurrentLongest. If the number num isn't bigger than the previous one, it means that a new sequence starts, and we have to start the count from 1. Finally, after all the checks are done, numPrev becomes the number that we're currently using, and we start the loop from the beginning with the next entered num.\nHere is a sample implementation of the algorithm described:\n\nWhat remains is to see which of all sequences is the longest. We will do this by checking in the loop if the sequence we are currently in has become longer than the longest one by now. The whole loop will look like this:\n\nFinally, we print the length of the longest sequence found.\n\nTesting in The Judge System\nTest your solution here: https://judge.softuni.org/Contests/Practice/Index/939#7.\nProblems for Drawing Figures on The Console\nThe fifth problem of the Practical Exam requires using one or several nested loops for drawing a figure on the console. Logical reasoning, simple calculations, and conditional statements may be required. The problem tests the ability of students to think logically and invent simple algorithms for solving problems, i.e. to think algorithmically. Here are some examples of exam tasks:\nProblem: Perfect Diamond\nWrite a function that takes as a parameter n and draws a perfect diamond with size n as in the examples below.\nInput Data\nOne parameter - an integer n in the range [1 … 1000].\nOutput Data\nThe diamond should be printed on the console as in the examples below.\nSample Input and Output\n\n\n\nInput\nOutput\nInput\nOutput\n\n\n\n\n2\n * *-* * \n3\n  *   *-* *-*-* *-*   *  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nInput\nOutput\nInput\nOutput\n\n\n\n\n4\n   *     *-*   *-*-* *-*-*-* *-*-*   *-*     *   \n5\n    *       *-*     *-*-*   *-*-*-* *-*-*-*-* *-*-*-*   *-*-*     *-*       *    \n\n\n\nHints and Guidelines\nIn tasks for drawing figures, the most important thing to consider is the sequence in which we will draw. Which items are repeated and with what steps? We can see that the top and the bottom parts of the diamond are the same. The easiest way to solve the problem is by creating a loop that draws the upper part, and then another loop that draws the bottom part (opposite to the top one).\nWe will read the number n from the parameters of the function.\n\nWe start to draw the upper half of the diamond. We see that each line starts with some empty spaces and *.  If we take a closer look, we will notice that the empty spaces are always equal to the n - index of row - 1 (the first row is n-1, the second – n-2, etc.). We will start by drawing the number of empty spaces and the first star. Notice that we start to count from 0, no from 1. After that, we'll only add a few times -* to finish the line.\nHere is the fragment from the code for the upper part of the diamond:\n\nWhat remains is to complete each line with the required number of -* elements. On each row we have to add i such items (on the first 1-1 -> 0, the second -> 1, etc.)\nHere is the complete code for drawing the upper part of the diamond:\n\nTo draw the bottom part of the diamond, we have to reverse the upper part. We'll count from n - 2 because if we start from n - 1, we will draw the middle row twice. Do not forget to change the step from ++ to --.\nHere is the code for drawing the bottom part of the diamond:\n\nWhat remains is to assemble the whole program  by first reading the input, printing the top part of the diamond, and then the bottom part of the diamond.\nTesting in The Judge System\nTest your solution here: https://judge.softuni.org/Contests/Practice/Index/939#8.\nProblem: Rectangle with Stars\nWrite a function that takes as a parameter an integer n and draws a rectangle with size n with 2 stars in the center as in the examples below.\nInput Data\nThe parameter is an integer n in the range [2 … 1000].\nOutput Data\nThe rectangle should be printed on the console as in the examples below.\nSample Input and Output\n\n\n\nInput\nOutput\nInput\nOutput\n\n\n\n\n2\n%%%%%**%%%%%\n3\n%%%%%%%    %% ** %%    %%%%%%%\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInput\nOutput\nInput\nOutput\n\n\n\n\n4\n%%%%%%%%%      %%  **  %%      %%%%%%%%%\n5\n%%%%%%%%%%%        %%        %%   **   %%        %%        %%%%%%%%%%%\n\n\n\nHints and Guidelines\nWe read the input parameter of the function.\n\nThe first thing we can easily notice is that the first and the last rows contain 2 * n symbols %. We will start with this and then draw the middle part of the rectangle.\n\nFrom the examples, we see that the middle part of the figure always has an odd number of rows. Note that when an even number is set, the number of rows is equal to the previous odd number (2 -> 1, 4 -> 3, etc.). We create a variable that represents the number of rows that our rectangle will have, and correct it if the number n is even. Then we will draw a rectangle without the asterisks. Each row has for the beginning and at the end the symbol % and between them 2 * n - 2 empty spaces (the width is 2 * n and we subtract 2 for the two percent at the end). Do not forget to move the code for the last line after the loop.\n\nWe can start and test the code so far. Everything without the two asterisks in the middle should work correctly.\nNow, in the body of the loop let's add the asterisks. We'll check if we're on the middle row. If we are in the middle, we will draw the row together with the asterisks, if not – we will draw a normal row. The line with the asterisks has n-2 empty spaces (n is half the length and we remove the asterisk and the percentage), two stars, and again n-2 empty spaces. We leave out of the check the two percent at the beginning and the end of the row.\n\nTesting in The Judge System\nTest your solution here: https://judge.softuni.org/Contests/Practice/Index/939#9.\nProblems with Nested Loops\nThe last (sixth) problem of the Practical Exam requires using of several nested loops and more complex logic inside them. The problems examine participants' ability to think algorithmically and to solve non-trivial coding problems that require nested loops. Here are some examples of exam problems.\nProblem: Increasing 4 Numbers\nFor given pair of numbers a and b generate all four number n1, n2, n3, n4, for which a ≤ n1 .\nInput Data\nAs parameters of the function, we get two integers a and b in the range [0 … 1000].\nOutput Data\nThe output contains all numbers in batches of four, in ascending order, one per line.\nSample Input and Output\n\n\n\nInput\nOutput\nInput\nOutput\n\n\n\n\n37\n3 4 5 63 4 5 73 4 6 73 5 6 74 5 6 7\n1520\n15 16 17 1815 16 17 1915 16 17 2015 16 18 1915 16 18 2015 16 19 2015 17 18 1915 17 18 2015 17 19 2015 18 19 2016 17 18 1916 17 18 2016 17 19 2016 18 19 2017 18 19 20\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInput\nOutput\nInput\nOutput\n\n\n\n\n57\nNo\n1013\n10 11 12 13\n\n\n\nHints and Guidelines\nWe read the input data from the function. We also create the additional variable count, which will keep track of existing number ranges.\n\nWe will most easily solve the problem if we logically divide it into parts. If we are required to draw all the rows from a number between a and b, we will do it using one loop that takes all the numbers from a to b. Let's think about how to do this with a series of two numbers. The answer is easy – we will use nested loops.\n\nWe can test the incomplete program to see if it's accurate so far. It must print all pairs of numbers i, j for which i ≤ j.\nSince each next number of the row must be greater than the previous one, the second loop will run around i + 1 (the next greater number). Accordingly, if there is no sequence of two incremental numbers (a and b are equal), the second loop will not be fulfilled, and nothing will be printed on the console.\nSimilarly, what remains is to implement the nested loops for four numbers. We will add an increase of the counter that we initialized to know if there is such a sequence.\n\nFinally, we will check if the counter is equal to 0 and we will print \"No\" on the console accordingly, if so.\n\nTesting in The Judge System\nTest your solution here: https://judge.softuni.org/Contests/Practice/Index/939#10.\nProblem: Generating Rectangles\nBy a given number n and a minimum area m, generate all possible rectangles with integer coordinates in the range [-n…n] with an area of at least m. The generated rectangles must be printed in the following format:\n(left, top) (right, bottom) -> area\nRectangles are defined using the top left and bottom right corners. The following inequalities are in effect:\n\n-n ≤ left \n-n ≤ top \n\nInput Data\nWe get two integers as parameters of the function:\n\nAn integer n in the range [1 … 100] – sets the minimum and maximum coordinates of a peak.\nAn integer m in the range [0 … 50 000] – sets the minimum area of the generated rectangles\n\nOutput Data\n\nThe described rectangles should be printed on the console in a format such as in the examples below.\nIf there are no rectangles for the specified n and m, then print \"No\".\nThe order of rectangles in the output is not important.\n\nSample Input and Output\n\n\n\nInput\nOutput\nInput\nOutput\n\n\n\n\n12\n(-1, -1) (0, 1) -> 2(-1, -1) (1, 0) -> 2(-1, -1) (1, 1) -> 4(-1, 0) (1, 1) -> 2(0, -1) (1, 1) -> 2\n217\nNo\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInput\nOutput\n\n\n\n\n336\n(-3, -3) (3, 3) -> 36\n\n\n\nHints and Guidelines\nWe read the input parameters of the function. We will also create a counter, which will store the number of rectangles found.\n\nIt is very important to be able to imagine the problem before we begin to solve it. In our case, it is required to search for rectangles in a coordinate system. The thing we know is that the left point will always have the coordinate x, smaller than the right one. Accordingly, the upper one will always have a smaller y coordinate than the lower one. To find all the rectangles, we'll have to create a loop similar to the previous problem, but this time, not every next loop will start from the next number because some of the coordinates can be equal (for example left and top).\n\nThe important thing here is knowing the corresponding coordinates so we can correctly calculate the sides of the rectangle. Now we have to find the area of the rectangle and check if it is greater than or equal to m. One side will be the difference between left and right and the other one – between top and bottom. Since the coordinates may be eventually interchanged, we will use absolute values. Again, we add the counter in the loop, counting only the rectangles we write. It is important to note that the writing order is left, top, right, bottom, as it is set in the problem's description.\n\nFinally, we print “No”, if there are no such rectangles.\n\nTesting in The Judge System\nTest your solution here: https://judge.softuni.org/Contests/Practice/Index/939#11.\n"},"chapter-08-exam-preparation-part-2.html":{"url":"chapter-08-exam-preparation-part-2.html","title":"8.2. Practical Exam Preparation – Part II","keywords":"","body":"Chapter 8.2. Exam Preparation - Part II\nIn the current chapter, we will review a practical exam, conducted at SoftUni on December 18, 2016. The problems will give you a good overview of what you can expect at an admission exam in Programming at SoftUni. The exam covers the material studied in the current book.\nExam Problems\nTraditionally, the admission exam at SoftUni consists of 6 practical programming problems:\n\nSimple problems (no conditions).\nA problem with a single condition.\nA problem with more complex conditions.\nA problem with a single loop.\nA problem with nested loops (drawing a figure on the console).\nA problem with nested loops and more complex logic.\n\nLet's examine a real exam topic, the problems it contains, and their solutions.\nProblem: Distance\nWrite a program that calculates what is the distance passed by a car (in kilometers), if we know the initial speed (km/h), the initial time frame in minutes, then the speed is increased by 10%, the second time frame, then the speed is decreased by 5%, and the time until the end of the trip.

Let's separate the problem into a few sub-problems and try to solve each of them one by one, which will lead us to the final result:\n\nReceiving the input data.\nExecution of the main programming logic.\nCalculation and shaping up the final result.\n\nThe main part of the programming logic is to calculate what will be the distance passed after all speed changes. As during execution of the program, part of the data that we have is modified, we could separate the program code into a few logically separated parts:\n\nCalculation of the distance passed with initial speed.\nChange of speed and calculation of the distance passed.\nLast change of speed and calculation.\nSumming up.\n\nOn condition for input will be submitted four arguments of the function which we have to convert to numbers to make needed calculations. We will convert them using the  Number(...) constructor:\n \nIn this way, we solved successfully the first sub-problem - receiving the input data.\nWe initially store one variable that will be used multiple times. This centralization approach gives us flexibility and the possibility to modify the final result of the program with minimum effort. In case we need to change the value, we must do it in only one place in the code, which saves us time and effort:\n\n\n\n\nAvoiding repetitive code (centralization of the program logic) in the tasks that we examine in the present book may look unnecessary at first glance, but this approach is very important upon building large applications in a real work environment, and its exercising in an initial stage of training will help you build a quality programming style.\n\n\n\n\nWe calculate the travel time (in hours) by dividing the time by 60 (minutes in an hour). The travel distance is calculated by multiplying the starting speed by the time passed (in hours). After that, we change the speed by increasing it by 10%(on condition), as per the task description. Calculating the percentage, as well as the following distances passed, is done in the following way:\n\nThe time frame (in hours) is calculated by dividing the provided time frame in minutes by the minutes that are contained in an hour (60).\nThe distance passed is calculated by multiplying the time frame (in hours) by the speed that is obtained after the increase.\nThe next step is to decrease the speed by 5%, as per the problem description.\nWe calculate the remaining distance in the manner described in the first two points.\n\n\nUp until now, we were able to solve two of the most important sub-problems, namely the receiving data input and their processing. What remains is to calculate the final result. As by the description, we are required to format it up to 2 symbols after the decimal point, we can do this in the following manner:\n\nIf you worked accurately and wrote the program using the input data given in the task description, you will be convinced that it works properly.\nTesting in The Judge System\nTest your solution here: https://judge.softuni.org/Contests/Practice/Index/940#0.\nProblem: Changing Tiles\nHaralambi has some savings that he wants to use to change the tiles on the bathroom floor. The floor is rectangular, and the tiles are triangular. Write a program that calculates if his savings will be sufficient. The width and length of the floor are submitted, as well as one of the sides of the triangle with its height towards it. We must calculate how many tiles are needed, to cover the floor. The number of tiles must be rounded up to the higher integer and 5 more tiles must be added as spare tiles. Also, we have submitted – the price per tile and the amount paid for the work of a workman.\nInput Data\nWe submit 7 numbers as parameters of the function:\n\nThe savings.\nThe width of the floor.\nThe length of the floor.\nThe side of the triangle.\nThe height of the triangle.\nThe price of a tile.\nThe sum for the workman.\n\nAll numbers are real numbers within the range [0.00 … 5000.00].\nOutput Data\nIn this problem, our currency will be lv, which is BGN (Bulgarian lev).\nThe following must be printed on the console as a single line:\n\nIf the money is sufficient:\n“{Remaining funds}  left.”\n\n\nIf the money IS NOT sufficient:\n“You'll need {Insufficient funds} lv more.”\n\n\n\nThe result must be formatted up to the second symbol after the decimal point.\nSample Input and Output\n\n\n\nInput\nOutput\nComments\n\n\n\n\n50032.50.50.77.80100\n25.60 lv left.\nFloor area → 3 * 2.5 = 7.5Tile area → 0.5 * 0.7 / 2 = 0.175Needed tiles → 7.5 / 0.175 = 42.857… = 43 + 5 spare tiles = 48Total amount → 48 * 7.8 + 100 (workman) = 474.4474.4  → 25.60 lv (BGN) left\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInput\nOutput\nComments\n\n\n\n\n10005.558.950.900.8513.99321\nYou'll need 1209.65 lv more.\nFloor area → 5.55 * 8.95 = 49.67249Tile area → 0.9 * 0.85 / 2 = 0.3825Needed tiles → 49.67249 / 0.3825 = 129.86… = 130 + 5 spare tiles = 135Total amount → 135 * 13.99 + 321 (workman) = 2209.652209.65 > 1000 → 1209.65 lv (BGN) are insufficient\n\n\n\nHints and Guidelines\nThe following task requires our problem to accept more input data and to perform a larger number of calculations, even though the solution is identical. Accepting the input data is done familiarly.\nNow that we already have everything for executing the programming logic, we can move to the following part. How can we calculate what is the needed number of tiles that will be sufficient to cover the entire floor? The requirement is that tiles have a triangular shape, which can confuse, but practically, the task needs just simple calculations. We can calculate the common part of the floor by the formula for finding a rectangle area, as well as the area of a single tile using the relevant formula for the triangle area.\nTo calculate the number of tiles that are needed, we divide the floor area by the area of a single tile (we should not forget to add the 5 additional tiles, that were mentioned in the requirements).\n\n\n\nPay attention that the requirements state that we should round up the number of tiles, obtained upon the division, up to the higher number, and then we should add 5. Find more information about the system functionality that does that: Math.ceil(…).\n\n\n\nWe can find the final result by calculating the total amount that is needed to cover the entire floor, by summing up the tile price and the price that will be paid to the workman, that we have from the input data. We can figure out that the total costs for tiles can be calculated by multiplying the number of tiles by the price per tile. We will find out whether the amount that we have will be sufficient by comparing the savings (based on the input data) and the total costs:\n\nTesting in The Judge System\nTest your solution here: https://judge.softuni.org/Contests/Practice/Index/940#1.\nProblem: Flowers\nA flowers shop offers 3 types of flowers: chrysanthemums, roses, and tulips.

We need to pay more attention to the moment of making changes in the final price, to be able to properly build the logic of our program. Again, the bold text gives us sufficient guidelines on how to proceed. For a start, we will separate the already defined values in variables, as we did in the previous tasks:\n\nWe will also do the same for the rest of the defined values:\n\nOur next sub-task is to read properly the input data from the console. We will familiarly do that by converting them into numbers:\n\nLet's think of the most appropriate way to structure our programming logic. By the requirements, it becomes clear that the path of the program is divided mainly into two parts: spring / summer and autumn / winter. We can do the separation by a conditional statement, by storing variables in advance for the prices of the individual flowers, as well as for the final result:\n\nWhat remains is to perform a few checks regarding the discounts of the different types of flowers, depending on the season, and to modify the final result.\nTesting in The Judge System\nTest your solution here: https://judge.softuni.org/Contests/Practice/Index/940#2.\nProblem: Grades\nWrite a program that calculates statistics for grades in an exam. In the beginning, the program receives the number of students who attended the exam and for each student – their grade. In the end, the program must print the percentage of students that have grades between 2.00 and 2.99, between 3.00 and 3.99, between 4.00 and 4.99, 5.00 or more, as well as the average grade of the exam.\nInput Data\nThe function receives a sequence of numbers (arguments):\n\nOn the first line (argument) – the number of students who attended the exam – an integer within the range [1 … 1000].\nFor each student on a separate line (argument) – the grade on the exam – a real number within the range [2.00 … 6.00].\n\nOutput Data\nPrint on the console 5 lines that hold the following information:\n\n\"Top students: {percentage of students with a grade of 5.00 or more}%\".\n\"Between 4.00 and 4.99: {between 4.00 and 4.99 included}%\".\n\"Between 3.00 and 3.99: {between 3.00 and 3.99 included}%\".\n\"Fail: {less than 3.00}%\".\n\"Average: {average grade}\".\n\nThe results must be formatted up to the second symbol after the decimal point.\nSample Input and Output\n\n\n\nInput\nOutput\nComments\n\n\n\n\n103.002.995.683.01446.004.502.445\nTop students: 30.00%Between 4.00 and 4.99: 30.00%Between 3.00 and 3.99: 20.00%Fail: 20.00%Average: 4.06\n5 or more - 3 students = 30% of 10Between 4.00 and 4.99 - 3 students = 30% of 10Between 3.00 and 3.99 - 2 students = 20% of 10Under 3 - 2 students = 20% of 10The average grade is: 3 + 2.99 + 5.68 + 3.01 + 4 + 4 + 6 + 4.50 + 2.44 + 5 = 40.62 / 10 = 4.062\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInput\nOutput\n\n\n\n\n6234562.2\nTop students: 33.33%Between 4.00 and 4.99: 16.67%Between 3.00 and 3.99: 16.67%Fail: 33.33%Average: 3.70\n\n\n\nHints and Guidelines\nBy the requirements, we see that first, we will receive the number of students, and then, their grades. For that reason, first, we will obtain the number of students. To process the grades themselves, we will use a for loop. Every iteration of the loop will read and process one grade:\n\nBefore executing the code of the for loop, we will create variables where we will store the number of students for each group: poor results (up to 2.99), results from 3 to 3.99, from 4 to 4.99, and grades above 5. We will also need one more variable, where we will store the sum of all grades, via which we will calculate the average grade of all students:\n\nWe run the loop and inside it, we declare one more variable, in which we will store the currently entered grade. The variable will be Number type and upon each iteration, we will check what is its value. According to this value, we increase the number of students in the relevant group by 1, as we should not forget to also increase the total amount of the grades, which we also track:\n\nWe can calculate what percentage is taken by a particular group of students from the total number by multiplying the number of students in the relevant group by 100 and then dividing this by the total number of students. \nThe final result is formed in a well-known way up to the second symbol after the decimal point.\nTesting in The Judge System\nTest your solution here: https://judge.softuni.org/Contests/Practice/Index/940#3.\nProblem: Christmas Hat\nWrite a program that reads from the console an integer n and draws a Christmas hat with a width of 4 * n + 1 columns and a height of 2 * n + 5 rows, as in the examples below.\nInput Data\nThe parameter of the function is passed one argument - an integer n within the range [3 … 100]. \nOutput Data\nPrint on the console a Christmas hat, exactly like in the examples.\nSample Input and Output\n\n\n\nInput\nOutput\n\n\n\n\n4\n......./|\\..............\\|/..............***.............*-*-*...........*--*--*.........*---*---*.......*----*----*.....*-----*-----*...*------*------*.*-------*-------*******************.*.*.*.*.*.*.*.******************\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInput\nOutput\n\n\n\n\n7\n............./|\\..........................\\|/..........................***.........................*-*-*.......................*--*--*.....................*---*---*...................*----*----*.................*-----*-----*...............*------*------*.............*-------*-------*...........*--------*--------*.........*---------*---------*.......*----------*----------*.....*-----------*-----------*...*------------*------------*.*-------------*-------------*******************************.*.*.*.*.*.*.*.*.*.*.*.*.*.******************************\n\n\n\nHints and Guidelines\nIn tasks requiring drawing on the console, most often the user inputs an integer that is related to the total size of the figure that we need to draw. As the task requirements mention how the total length and width of the figure are calculated, we can use them as starting points. In the examples, it is clear that regardless of the input data, we always have the first two rows that are almost identical.\n......./|\\..............\\|/.......\nWe also notice that the last three rows are always present, as two of them are completely the same.\n******************.*.*.*.*.*.*.*.******************\nBy these observations, we can come up with the formula for the height of the variable part of the Christmas hat. We use the formula specified in the task to calculate the total height, by subtracting the size of the unchangeable part. We obtain (2 * n + 5) – 5 or 2 * n.\nTo draw the dynamic or the variable part of the figure, we will use a loop. The size of the loop will be from 0 to the width that we have by requirements, namely 4 * n + 1. Since we will use this formula in a few places in the code, it is a good practice to declare it in a separate variable. Before running the loop, we should declare variables for the number of individual symbols that participate in the dynamic part: dots and dashes. By analyzing examples, we can also prepare formulas for the starting values of these variables. Initially, the dashes are 0, but we can calculate the number of dots by subtracting 3 from the total width (the number of symbols that are building the top of the Christmas hat) and then dividing by 2, as the number of dots on both sides of the hat is the same.\n.......***.............*-*-*...........*--*--*.........*---*---*.......*----*----*.....*-----*-----*...*------*------*.*-------*-------*\nWhat remains is to execute the body of the loop, as after each drawing we decrease the number of dots by 1 and increase the number of dashes by 1. Let's not forget to draw one star between each of them. The sequence of drawing in the body of the loop is the following:\n\nSymbol string of dots\nStar\nSymbol string of dashes\nStar\nSymbol string of dashes\nStar\nSymbol string of dots\n\nIn case we have worked properly, we will obtain figures identical to those in the examples.\nTesting in The Judge System\nTest your solution here: https://judge.softuni.org/Contests/Practice/Index/940#4.\nProblem: Letters Combinations\nWrite a program that prints on the console all combinations of 3 letters within a specified range, by skipping the combinations containing a certain letter. Finally, print the number of printed combinations.\nInput Data\nThe input of the program contains exactly 3 lines (arguments):\n\nA small letter from the English alphabet – between 'a' and 'z'.\nA small letter from the English alphabet – between the first letter and 'z'.\nA small letter from the English alphabet – from 'a' to 'z' – as the combinations containing this letter are skipped.\n\nOutput Data\nPrint on one line all combinations corresponding to the requirements, followed by their number, separated by a space.\nSample Input and Output\n\n\n\nInput\nOutput\nComments\n\n\n\n\nacb\naaa aac aca acc caa cac cca ccc 8\nAll possible combinations with letters 'a', 'b' and 'c' are:aaa aab aac aba abb abc aca acb acc baa bab bac bba bbb bbc bca bcb bcc caa cab cac cba cbb cbc cca ccb cccThe combinations containing 'b' are not valid.8 valid combinations remain.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInput\nOutput\n\n\n\n\nfkh\nfff ffg ffi ffj ffk fgf fgg fgi fgj fgk fif fig fii fij fik fjf fjg fji fjj fjk fkf fkg fki fkj fkk gff gfg gfi gfj gfk ggf ggg ggi ggj ggk gif gig gii gij gik gjf gjg gji gjj gjk gkf gkg gki gkj gkk iff ifg ifi ifj ifk igf igg igi igj igk iif iig iii iij iik ijf ijg iji ijj ijk ikf ikg iki ikj ikk jff jfg jfi jfj jfk jgf jgg jgi jgj jgk jif jig jii jij jik jjf jjg jji jjj jjk jkf jkg jki jkj jkk kff kfg kfi kfj kfk kgf kgg kgi kgj kgk kif kig kii kij kik kjf kjg kji kjj kjk kkf kkg kki kkj kkk 125\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInput\nOutput\n\n\n\n\nacz\naaa aab aac aba abb abc aca acb acc baa bab bac bba bbb bbc bca bcb bcc caa cab cac cba cbb cbc cca ccb ccc 27\n\n\n\nHints and Guidelines\nBy requirements, we have input data of 3 arguments, each of which is represented by one character of the ASCII table (https://www.asciitable.com/). We could use the already defined method in JavaScript, .charCodeAt() through which we will receive the ASCII code of the symbol:\n\nLet's think of how we can achieve the final result. In case the task requirement is to print all characters, from the starting to the end one (by skipping a particular letter), what should we do?\nThe easiest and most efficient way is to use a loop, by passing through all characters and printing those that are different from the letter that we need to skip. In JavaScript, we can go around all the symbols from 'a' to 'z' in this way:\n\nThe method String.fromCharCode(...) will convert the received ASCII code into a symbol. The result of running the code is all letters from a to z included, printed on a single line and separated by spaces. Does this look like the final result of our task? We must find a way to print 3 characters, as required, instead of 1. Running such a program very much looks like a slot machine. We often win in slots, if we arrange a few identical characters in a row. Let's say that the machine has space for three characters. When we stop on a particular character in the first place, the other two places will continue rolling characters among all possible ones. In our case, all possible characters are the letters from the starting to the end one, entered by the user, and the solution of our program is identical to the way a slot machine works.\nWe use a loop that runs through all characters from the starting to the end letter (included). On each iteration of the first loop, we run a second one with the same parameters (but only if the letter of the first loop is valid, i.e. does not match the one that we must exclude, by requirements). In each iteration of the second loop, we run one more with the same parameters and the same condition. This way we have three nested loops and in the body of the latter we will add the symbols to the final result:\n\nLet's not forget that we also need to print the total number of valid combinations that we have found, and they must be printed on the same line, separated by a space.

If you want to become a champion on the basics of programming, we recommend this training to solve such complex tasks to make it easy for you to take exams.\nProblem: Crossing Sequences\nWe have two sequences:\n\na sequence of Tribonacci (by analogy with the Fibonacci sequence), where each number is the sum of the previous three (with given three numbers)\na sequence generated by a numerical spiral defined by looping like a spiral (right, bottom, left, top, right, bottom, left, top, etc.) of a matrix of numbers starting from its center with a given starting number and incremental step, by storing the current numbers in the sequence each time we make a turn.\n\nWrite a program that finds the first number that appears in both sequences defined in an aforementioned way.\nProblem\nLet the Tribonacci sequence start with 1, 2 and 3. This means that the first sequence will contain the numbers 1, 2, 3, 6, 11, 20, 37, 68, 125, 230, 423, 778, 1431, 2632, 4841, 8904, 16377, 30122, 55403, 101902, and so on.\nAt the same time, let the numbers in the spiral begin with 5, and the spiral increases by 2 at each step.\n\nThen the second sequence will contain the numbers 5, 7, 9, 13, 17, 23, 29, 37, and so on. We see that 37 is the first number to be found in the Tribonacci sequence and the spiral one, and that is the desired solution to the problem.\nInput Data\nAs parameters of the function, we pass 5 integers.\n\nThe first three parameters will represent the first three numbers in the Tribonacci sequence, positive non-zero numbers, sorted in ascending order.\nThe next two parameters are representing the first number and the step for each cell of the matrix for the spiral of numbers. Numbers representing the spiral are positive non-zero numbers.\n\nInput data will always be valid and will always be in the format described. There is no need to check.\nOutput Data\nThe result should be printed on the console.\nOn the single line of the output, we must print the smallest number that occurs in both sequences. If there is no number in the range [1 … 1 000 000], that can be found in both sequences, then print \"No\".\nConstraints\n\nAll numbers in the input will be in the range [1 … 1 000 000].\nAllowed program time: 0.3 seconds.\nAllowed memory: 16 MB.\n\nSample Input and Output\n\n\n\nInput\nOutput\nInput\nOutput\nInput\nOutput\n\n\n\n\n12352\n37\n13259952\n13\n99999922\nNo\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInput\nOutput\nInput\nOutput\n\n\n\n\n11111\n1\n147233\n23\n\n\n\nHints and Guidelines\nThe problem seems quite complicated, so we will break it into simpler sub-problems.\nProcessing The Input\nThe first step in solving the problem is to read and process the input. Input data consists of 5 integers: 3 for the Tribonacci sequence and 2 for the numerical spiral:\n\nOnce we have the input data, we need to think about how we will generate the numbers in the two sequences.\nGenerating Tribonacci Sequence\nFor the Tribonacci sequence, we will always collect the previous three values and then move the values of those numbers (the three previous ones) to one position in the sequence, i.e. the value of the first one must accept the value of the second one, and so on. When we are done with the number, we will store its value in an array. Since the problem description states that the numbers in the sequences do not exceed 1,000,000, we can stop generating this range at exactly 1,000,000:\n\nGenerating Numerical Spiral\nWe need to think of a relationship between numbers in the numerical spiral so we can easily generate every next number without having to look at matrices and loop through them. If we carefully look at the picture from the description, we will notice that every 2 \"turns\" in the spiral, the numbers we skip are increased by 1, i.e. from 5 to 7 and from 7 to 9, not a single number is skipped, but we directly add with the step of the sequence. From 9 to 13 and from 13 to 17 we skip a number, i.e. we add the step twice. From 17 to 23 and from 23 to 29 we skip two numbers, i.e. we add the step three times and so on.\nThus, we see that for the first two we have the last number + 1 * the step, the next two we add with the 2 * the step and so on. Every time we want to get to the next number of the spiral, we will have to make such calculations:\n\nWhat we have to take care of is for every two numbers, our multiplier (let's call it \"coefficient\") must increase by 1 (spiralStepMul++), which can be achieved with a simple check (spiralCount % 2 == 0). The whole code from the generation of the spiral in an array is given below:\n\nFinding Common Number for The Sequences\nOnce we have generated the numbers in both sequences, we can proceed to unite them and build the final solution. How will it look? For each of the numbers in the first sequence (starting from the smaller one) we will check if it exists in the other one. The first number that meets this criterion will be the answer to the problem.\nWe will do a linear search in the second array, and we will leave the more curious participants to optimize it using the technique called binary search because the second array is generated in sorted form, i.e. it meets the requirement to apply this type of search. The code for finding our solution will look like this:\n\nThe solution to the problem uses arrays to store the values. Arrays are not needed to solve the problem. There is an alternative solution that generates the numbers and works directly with them instead of keeping them in an array. On every step, we can check whether the numbers in the two sequences match. If this is the case, we will print the number on the console and terminate the execution of our program. Otherwise, we will see the current number of which sequence is the smaller one and we will generate the next one where we are \"lagging\". The idea is that we will generate numbers from the sequence that is \"behind\" until we skip the current number of the other sequence and then vice versa, and if we find a match in the meantime, we will terminate the execution:\n\nTesting in The Judge System\nTest your solution here: https://judge.softuni.org/Contests/Practice/Index/941#0.\nProblem: Magic Dates\nDate is given in a \"dd-mm-yyyy\" format, e.g. 17-04-2018. We calculate the weight of that date by taking all of its digits, multiplying each digit with the others after it, and finally summing up all the results obtained. In our case, we have 8 digits: 17032007, so the weight is 1*7 + 1*0 + 1*3 + 1*2 + 1*0 + 1*0 + 1*7 + 7*0 + 7*3 + 7*2 + 7*0 + 7*0 + 7*7 + 0*3 + 0*2 + 0*0 + 0*0 + 0*7 + 3*2 + 3*0 + 3*0 + 3*7 + 2*0 + 2*0 + 2*7 + 0*0 + 0*7 + 0*7 = 144.\nOur task is to write a program that finds all the magical dates between two specific years (inclusively) corresponding to the given weight. Dates must be printed in ascending order (by date) in the format \"dd-mm-yyyy\". We will only use the valid dates in the traditional calendar (the leap years have 29 days in February).\nInput Data\nInput data consists of 3 lines:\n\nThe first integer: start year.\nThe second integer: end year.\nThe third integer: the search weight for the dates.\n\nInput data will always be valid and will always be in the format described. There is no need to check.\nOutput Data\nThe result should be printed on the console as consecutive dates in \"dd-mm-yyyy\" format, sorted by date in ascending order. Each string must be in a separate line. If there are no existing magic dates, print \"No\".\nConstraints\n\nThe start and final years are integer numbers in the range [1900 … 2100].\nMagic weight is an integer in the range [1 … 1000].\nAllowed program time: 0.25 seconds.\nAllowed memory: 16 MB.\n\nSample Input and Output\n\n\n\nInput\nOutput\nInput\nOutput\n\n\n\n\n20072007144\n17-03-200713-07-200731-07-2007\n200320041500\nNo\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInput\nOutput\nInput\nOutput\n\n\n\n\n2012201480\n09-01-201317-01-201323-03-201311-07-201301-09-201310-09-201309-10-201317-10-201307-11-201324-11-201314-12-201323-11-201413-12-201431-12-2014\n2011201214\n01-01-201110-01-201101-10-201110-10-2011\n\n\n\nHints and Guidelines\nWe start with the input data. In this case, we have 3 integers:\n\nHaving the start and the end year, it is nice to know how we will go through every date, not to worry about how many days there are in the month and whether it is a leap year, and so on.\nLoop Through Dates\nFor looping through the dates, we will take advantage of the functionality that gives us the Date object in JavaScript. We will define a start date variable that we can do using the constructor that accepts a year, month, and day. We know the year is the starting year we read from the console and the month and the day must be January and 1st respectively. In JavaScript, the \"constructor\" of Date accepts as the first argument the year, as second argument the month (0 is January, 11 is December) and as the third argument the day of the month:\n\nOnce we have the start date, we want to create a loop that runs until we exceed the final year (or until we pass December 31 in the final year if we compare the full dates), increasing each day by 1 day.\nTo increase by one day in each rotation, we will use a method of Date - setDate(…), which will add one day to the current date. The method will take care instead of us, to decide where to skip the next month, how many days there is a month, and everything around the leap years:\n\nIn JavaScript, we have to use the method getFullYear() to get the year in the same format as it is in the input data. If we use the method getYear() we will get the number of years passed from 1900 until the searched data, which will not help us with our problem. In conclusion, our loop should look like that:\n\nCaution: we can do the same thing using for loop, the initialization of the date will be in the first past of the for, the condition stays the same, and the step is incremented with one day.\nCalculating Date Weight\nEach date consists of exactly 8 characters (digits) – 2 for the day (d1, d2), 2 for the month (d3, d4), and 4 for the year (d5 to d8). This means that we will always have the same calculation every time, and we can benefit from this to define the formula statically (i.e. not to use loops, referring to different numbers from the date, but write the whole formula). To be able to write it, we will need all digits from the date in individual variables to make all the necessary multiplications. By using the division and partition operations on the individual components of the date, using the getDay(), getMonth(), and getFullYear() methods, we can retrieve each digit. We have to pay attention to getMonth(), because the method returns a number between 0 (January) and 11 (December) and we have to add +1, to get the months between [1-12]. Another thing that we have to be careful with is the division by 10 (/ 10), which won't be an integer division, that's why after each operation we have to round specifically to the lowest integer number by using Math.floor(…):\n\nLet's also explain one of the more interesting lines here. Let's take the second digit of the year for example (d6). We divide the year by 100, and we take a remainder of 10. What do we do? First, we eliminate the last 2 digits of the year by dividing by 100 (Example: 2018/100 = 20). With the remainder of 10, we take the last digit of the resulting number (20 % 10 = 0) and so we get 0, which is the second digit of 2018.\nWhat remains is to do the calculation that will give us the magical weight of a given date. To not write all multiplications as shown in the example, we will simply apply a grouping. What we need to do is multiply each digit with those that follow it. Instead of typing d1 * d2 + d1 * d3 + … + d1 * d8, we can shorten this expression to d1 * (d2 + d3 + … + d8) for grouping when we have multiplication and summing up. Applying the same simplification for the other multiplications, we get the following formula:\n\nPrinting The Output\nOnce we have the weight calculated for a given date, we need to check and see if it matches the magical weight we want, to know if it should be printed or not. Checking can be done using a standard if block, taking care to print the date in the correct format. Fortunately, we already have each one of the digits that we need to print d1 until d8. Here we have to be careful with the data types. Since the concatenation of strings and the summation are done by the same operator, we have to convert numbers to strings or start the concatenation with an empty string: \n\nCaution: as we go through the dates from the start year to the end one, they will always be arranged in ascending order as per the description.\nFinally, if we have not found an eligible date, we will have a false value in the found variable and we will be able to print No:\n\nTesting in The Judge System\nTest your solution here: https://judge.softuni.org/Contests/Practice/Index/941#1.\nProblem: Five Special Letters\nTwo numbers are given: start and end. Write a program that generates all combinations of 5 letters, each among the sets of {'a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e'} so that the weight of these 5 letters is a number in the range [start … end], inclusive. Print them in alphabetical order, in a single row, separated by a space.\nThe weight of the letters is calculated as follows:\nweight('a') = 5;\nweight('b') = -12;\nweight('c') = 47;\nweight('d') = 7;\nweight('e') = -32;\n\nThe weight of the sequence of the letters c1, c2, …, cn is calculated by removing all the letters that are repeated (from right to left) and then calculating the formula:\nweight(c1, c2, …, cn) = 1 * weight(c1) + 2 * weight(c2) + … + n * weight(cn)\n\nFor example, the weight of bcddc is calculated as follows:\nFirst, we remove the repeating letters and get bcd. Then we apply the formula: 1 * weight('b') + 2 * weight('c') + 3 * weight('d') = 1 * (-12) + 2 * 47 + 3 * 7 = 103.\nAnother example: weight(\"cadae\") = weight(\"cade\") = 1 * 47 + 2 * 5 + 3 * 7 + 4 * (-32) = -50.\nInput Data\nThe input data is read from the console. It consists of two numbers:\n\nThe number for a start.\nThe number for an end.\n\nInput data will always be valid and will always be in the format described. There is no need to check.\nOutput Data\nThe result should be printed on the console as a sequence of strings, arranged in alphabetical order. Each string must be separated from the next one by a single space. If the weight of any of the 5 letter strings does not exist within the specified range, print \"No\".\nConstraints\n\nNumbers for start and end are integers in the range [-10000 … 10000].\nAllowed program time: 0.25 seconds.\nAllowed memory: 16 MB.\n\nSample Input and Output\n\n\n\nInput\nOutput\nComments\n\n\n\n\n4042\nbcead bdcea\nweight(\"bcead\") = 41weight(\"bdcea\") = 40\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInput\nOutput\n\n\n\n\n-11\nbcdea cebda eaaad eaada eaadd eaade eaaed eadaa eadad eadae eadda eaddd eadde eadea eaded eadee eaead eaeda eaedd eaede eaeed eeaad eeada eeadd eeade eeaed eeead\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInput\nOutput\n\n\n\n\n200300\nbaadc babdc badac badbc badca badcb badcc badcd baddc bbadc bbdac bdaac bdabc bdaca bdacb bdacc bdacd bdadc bdbac bddac beadc bedac eabdc ebadc ebdac edbac\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInput\nOutput\n\n\n\n\n300400\nNo\n\n\n\nHints and Guidelines\nLike every problem, we start the solution by reading and processing the input data:\n\nWe have several main points in the problem – generating all combinations with a length of 5 including the 5 letters, removing repeating letters, and calculating weight for a simplified word. The answer will consist of every word whose weight is within the given range [firstNumber, secondNumber].\nGenerating All Combinations\nTo generate all combinations with a length of 1 using 5 symbols, we would use a loop from 0..4, as we want each number of the loop to match one character. To generate any combinations of length 2 using 5 characters (i.e. \"aa\", \"ab\", \"ac\", …, \"ba\", …), we would create two nested loops each running through the digits from 0 to 4, as we will once again make sure that each digit matches a specific character. We will repeat this step 5 times, so we will finally have 5 nested loops with indexes i1, i2, i3, i4, and i5:\n\nNow that we have all 5-digit combinations, we must find a way to \"turn\" the five digits into a word with the letters from 'a' to 'e'. One of the ways to do that is to predefine a simple string that contains the letters that we have:\n\nFor each digit, we take the letter from the particular position. This way, the number 00000 will become \"aaaaa\", and the number 02423 will become \"acecd\". We can create the 5-letter string in the following way:\n\nAnother way: we can convert the digits to letters by using their arrangement in the ASCII table. The expression String.fromCharCode('a'.charCodeAt(0) + i) return the result 'a' in case i = 0, 'b' in case i = 1, 'c' in case i = 2, etc.\nThis way we already have generated all 5-letter combinations and can proceed with the following part of the task.\nAttention: as we have chosen a pattern that takes into consideration the alphabetical arrangement of the letters, and cycles are run appropriately, the algorithm will generate the works in alphabetical order and there is no need for additional sorting before printing the output.\nRemoving Repetitive Letters\nOnce we have the finished string, we have to remove all the repeating symbols. We will do this by adding the letters from left to right in a new string and each time before adding a letter, we will check if it already exists – if it does, we will skip it and if it doesn't, we will add it. To begin with, we will add the first letter to the starting string:\n\nThen we will do the same with the other 4, checking each time with the following condition and the indexOf(…) method. This can be done with a loop by fullWord (leaving it to the reader for exercise), and it can be done lazily by copy-paste:\n\nThe .indexOf(…) method returns the index of the particular element if it is found or -1 if the item is not found. Therefore, every time we get -1, it means that we still do not have this letter in the new string with unique letters and we can add it, and if we get a value other than -1, this will mean we already have the letter and we'll not add it.\nCalculating Weight\nCalculating the weight is simply going through the unique word (word) obtained in the last step, and for each letter, we need to take its weight and multiply it by the position. For each letter, we need to calculate what value we will multiply its position by, for example by using a switch construction:\n\nOnce we have the value of that letter, we should multiply it by its position. Because the indexes in the string differ by 1 from the actual positions, i.e. index 0 is position 1, index 1 is position 2, etc., we will add 1 to the indexes.\n\nAll intermediate results obtained must be added to the total amount for each letter of the 5-letter combination.\nPreparing The Output\nWhether a word needs to be printed is determined by its weight. We need a condition to determine if the current weight is in the range [start … end] passed to the input at the start of the program. If this is the case, we print the full word (fullWord).\nBe careful not to print the word with unique letters. It was only needed to calculate the weight!\nThe words are separated with a space and we'll accumulate them in an intermediate variable result, which is defined as an empty string at the beginning:\n\nFinal Touches\nThe condition is met unless we do not have a single word in the entered range. To find out if we have found a word, we can simply check whether the string result has its initial value (i.e., an empty string), if it does, we print No, otherwise we print the whole string without the last space (using the .trim(…) method):\n\nTesting in The Judge System\nTest your solution here: https://judge.softuni.org/Contests/Practice/Index/941#2.\n"},"chapter-09-problems-for-champions-part-2.html":{"url":"chapter-09-problems-for-champions-part-2.html","title":"9.2.

The goal is to learn how to construct more complex algorithms based on your knowledge collected up to the present moment.\nProblem: Passion Days\nLina has a real shopping passion. When she has some money, she immediately goes to the closest shopping center (mall) and tries to spend as much as she can on clothes, bags, and shoes. But her favorite thing is winter sales. Our task is to analyze her strange behavior and  calculate the purchases that Lina does when she enters the mall, as well as the money she has left when the shopping is over. All prices and money are in BGN (Bulgarian levs, lv).\nOur first argument of the function will be the amount that line has before she starts shopping. Our second argument will be a list of commands(strings), which Line will do. After that upon reading \"mall.Enter\"  command, Lina enters the mall and starts shopping until the \"mall.Exit\" command is given. When Lina starts shopping every next element from the array will be an action that Lina does. Each symbol in the string is a purchase or another action. String commands contain only symbols of the ASCII table. The ASCII code of each sign is related to what Lina must pay for each of the goods. You need to interpret the symbols in the following way:\n\nIf the symbol is a capital letter, Lina gets a 50% discount, which means that you must decrease the money she has by 50% of the numeric representation of the symbol from the ASCII table.\nIf the symbol is a small letter, Lina gets a 70% discount, which means that you must decrease the money she has by 30% of the numeric representation of the symbol from the ASCII table.\nIf the symbol is \"%\", Lina makes a purchase that decreases her money in half.\nIf the symbol is \"*\", Lina withdraws money from her debit card and adds 10 lv. to her available funds.\nIf the symbol is different from all of the aforementioned, Lina just purchases without discount, and in this case, you should simply subtract the value of the symbol from the ASCII table from her available funds.\n\nIf a certain value of her purchases is higher than her current available funds, Lina DOES NOT make the purchase. Lina's funds cannot be less than 0.\nThe shopping ends when the \"mall.Exit\" command is given. When this happens, you need to print the number of purchases made and the money that Lina has left.\nInput Data\nThe input data is two arguments. Our first argument will indicate the amount that Lina has before starting to purchase. Our second argument will be an array of strings that will be processed in the row they are given. After you receive the command \"mall.Enter\" every next element will be a string containing information about products/actions that Lina wants to do. In the array, we want to perform all the commands until we receive the \"mall.Exit\" command.\nAlways only one \"mall.Enter\" command will be given, as well as only one \"mall.Exit\" command.\nOutput Data\nThe output data must be printed on the console.\nWhen shopping is over, you must print on the console a particular output depending on what purchases have been made.\n\nIf no purchases have been made – \"No purchases. Money left: {remaining funds} lv.\"\nIf at least one purchase is made – \"{number of purchases} purchases. Money left: {remaining funds} lv.\"\n\nThe funds must be printed with an accuracy of up to 2 symbols after the decimal point.\nConstraints\n\nMoney is a float number within the range: [0 - 7.9 x 1028].\nThe number of strings between \"mall.Enter\" and \"mall.Exit\" will be within the range: [1-20].\nThe number of symbols in each string that represents a command will be within the range: [1-20].\nAllowed execution time: 0.1 seconds.\nAllowed memory: 16 MB.\n\nSample Input and Output\n\n\n\nInput\nOutput\nComment\n\n\n\n\n110mall.Enterdmall.Exit\n1 purchases.

After this purchase, she has: 110 - 30 = 80 lv.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInput\nOutput\nInput\nOutput\n\n\n\n\n110['mall.Enter''%''mall.Exit']\n1 purchases.

Money left: 58.10 lv.\n\n\n\nHints and Guidelines\nWe will separate the solution of the problem into three main parts:\n\nProcessing of the input.\nAlgorithm for solving the problem. \nFormatting the output.\n\nLet's examine each of the parts in detail.\nProcessing The Input Data\nThe input of our task consists of a few components:\n\nIn the first argument, we have all the money that Lina has for shopping.\nIn the second argument, we have an array that is a series of commands.\n\nWhen we have the money which Lina owns we can step into processing the commands, that we get.\nBut there is a detail that we need to take into consideration. The requirements state the following:\n\nOur second argument will be an array of commands. They will run one after another. When we receive the command \"mall.Enter\", our next element will be a string containing **information regarding the purchases/actions that Lina wants to perform. \n\nThis is where we need to take into consideration the fact that inside our array we should start processing commands, but only after we receive the command \"mall.Enter\". How can we do that? Using a while or a do-while loop is a good option. Here is an exemplary solution of how to skip all commands before processing the command \"mall.Enter\":\n\nWe can replace this while with for loop using only the condition and step of the for loop.\nHere is the place to say that by calling  i++ after the end of the loop is used to pass from the first command for processing because at the end of the loop command[i] points exactly to \"mall.Enter\", which mustn't be processed as action inside the mall.  \nAlgorithm for Solving The Problem\nThe algorithm for solving the problem is a direct one – we continue reading commands from the console until the command \"mall.Exit\" is passed. In the meantime, we process each symbol (char) of each one of the commands according to the rules specified in the task requirements, and in parallel, we modify the amount that Lina has and store the number of purchases.\nLet's examine the first two problems for our algorithm. The first problem concerns the way we read the commands until we reach the \"mall.Exit\" command. The solution that we previously saw uses a while-loop. The second problem for the task is to access each symbol of the command passed. Keeping in mind that the input data with the commands is a string type, the easiest way to access each symbol inside the strings is via a foreach loop. \nThis is how the code will look like:\n\nThe next part of the algorithm is to process the symbols from the commands, according to the following rules in the requirements:\n\n\nIf the symbol is a capital letter, Lina gets a 50% discount, which means that you must decrease the money she has by 50% of the numeric representation of the symbol from the ASCII table.\nIf the symbol is a small letter, Lina gets a 70% discount, which means that you must decrease the money she has by 30% of the numeric representation of the symbol from the ASCII table.\nIf the symbol is \"%\",  Lina purchases and that decreases her money in half.\nIf the symbol is \"*\", Lina withdraws money from her debit card and adds 10 lv. to her available funds.\nIf the symbol is different from all of the aforementioned, Lina just purchases without discount, and in this case, you should simply subtract the value of the symbol from the ASCII table from her available funds.\n\n\nLet's examine the problems that we will be facing in the first condition. The first one is how to distinguish if a particular symbol is a capital letter. We can use one of the following ways:\n\nKeeping in mind the fact that the letters in the alphabet have a particular order, we can use the following condition action >= 'A' && action , to check if our symbol is within the capital letters range.\n\nWe can use the method str.toUpperCase() and compare if the symbol is the same as the one we will receive from str.toUpperCase().\n\n\nThe other problem is how to skip a particular symbol if it is not an operation that requires more money than Lina has. This is doable using the continue construction.\nAn exemplary condition for the first part of the requirements looks like this:\n\nNote: the variable “purchases” is of int type, in which we store the number of all purchases.\nWe believe the reader should not have difficulties implementing all the other conditions because they are very similar to the first one.\nFormatting The Output\nAt the end of our task we must print a particular output, depending on the following condition:\n\n\nIf no purchases have been made – \"No purchases. Money left: {remaining funds} lv.\"\nIf at least one purchase is made – \"{number of purchases} purchases. Money left: {remaining funds} lv.\"\n\n\nThe printing operations are trivial, as the only thing we need to take into consideration is that the amount has to be printed with an accuracy of up to 2 symbols after the decimal point.\nHow can we do that? We will leave the answer to this question to the reader.\nTesting in The Judge System\nTest your solution here: https://judge.softuni.org/Contests/Practice/Index/942#0.\nProblem: X Expression\nBonny is an exceptionally powerful witch. As her natural power is not sufficient to successfully fight vampires and werewolves, she has started to master the power of Expressions. An expression is very hard to master because the spell relies on the ability to quickly solve mathematical expressions.\nTo use an \"Expression spell\", the witch must know the result of a mathematical expression in advance. An Expression spell consists of a few simple mathematical expressions. Each mathematical expression can contain operators for summing up, subtraction, multiplying, and/or division.\nThe expression is solved without considering the mathematical rules for calculating numerical expressions. This means that the priority is applied according to the sequence of the operators, and not the type of calculation that they do. The expression can contain brackets, as everything inside the brackets is calculated first. Every expression can contain multiple brackets, but no nested brackets:\n\nAn expression containing (…(…)…) is an invalid one.\nAn expression containing (…)…(…) is a valid one.\n\nProblem\nThe expression:\n\nis solved in the following way:\n\nBonny is very pretty, but not as wise, so she will need our help to master the power of Expressions.\nInput Data\nThe input data consists of a single text line, passed from the console. It contains a mathematical expression for calculation. The line always ends with the \"=\" symbol. The \"=\" symbol means the end of the mathematical expression.\nThe input data is always valid and always in the described format. No need to validate it.\nOutput Data\nThe output data must be printed on the console. The output consists of one line: the result of the calculated mathematical expression.\nThe result must be rounded up to the second digit after the decimal point.\nConstraints\n\nThe expressions will consist of a maximum of 2500 symbols.\nThe numbers of each mathematical expression will be within the range [1 … 9].\nThe operators in the mathematical expressions will always be among + (summing up), - (subtraction), / (division) or * (multiplying).\nThe result of the mathematical expression will be within the range [-100000.00 … 100000.00].\nAllowed execution time: 0.1 seconds.\nAllowed memory: 16 MB.\n\nSample Input and Output\n\n\n\nInput\nOutput\nInput\nOutput\n\n\n\n\n'4+6/5+(4*9-8)/7*2='\n8.57\n'3+(6/5)+(2*3/7)*7/2*(9/4+4*1)='\n110.63\n\n\n\nHints and Guidelines\nAs usual, we will first read and process the input, after that, we will solve the problem, and finally, we will print the result, formatted as required. In this example, our input will be 1 argument which doesn't need to be processed any further. We can directly go to solving our problem.\nAlgorithm for Solving The Problem\nFor the tasks of our problem we need to use some variables:\n\nOne variable will store our current result.\nOne variable will store the index we are currently on for our loop.\nOne variable will store our current index which we process.\nAnd our final variable will store the current operator from our string.\n\n\nNow that we already have our starting variables, we must decide what will be the main structure of our program. By the requirements, we understand that each expression ends with =, i.e. we must read and process symbols until we reach a =. This is followed by an accurately written while loop.\n\nOur next step is to process our symbol  variable.\nThe next step is the processing of our symbol variable. We have 3 possible cases for it:\n\nIf the symbol is a start of a sub-expression placed in brackets i.e. the found symbol is a (.\nIf the symbol is a digit between 0 and 9. But how can we check this? How can we check if our symbol is a digit? We can use for assistance the ASCII code of the symbol, via which we can use the following formula: [ASCII code of our symbol] – [ASCII code of the symbol 0] = [the digit that represents the symbol]. If the result of this condition is between 0 and 9, then our symbol is a number. ( We can also use directly '0' and '9' symbols or their ASCII codes.)\nIf the symbol is an operator, i.e. it is +, -, * or /.\n\n\nLet's examine the actions that we need to undertake in the relevant cases that we defined:\n\nIf our symbol is an operator, then the only thing we need to do is to set a new value for the expressionOperator variable.\nIf our symbol is a digit, then we need to change the current result of the expression depending on the current operator, i.e. if  expressionOperator is a -, then we must decrease the result by the numerical representation of the current symbol. We can get the numerical representation of the current symbol via the formula that we used upon checking the condition for this case (the [ASCII code of our symbol] – [the ASCII code of the symbol0] = [the digit that represents the symbol])\n\n\n\nIf our symbol is a (, this indicates the beginning of a sub-expression (an expression in brackets). By definition, the sub-expression must be calculated before modifying the result of the whole expression (the actions in brackets are performed first). This means that we will have a local result for the sub-expression and a local operator.\n\n\nAfter that, to calculate the sub-expression value, we will use the same methods that we used for calculating the main expression – we use a while loop to read symbols (until we reach an ) symbol). Depending on whether the read symbol is a number or an operator, we modify the result of the sub-expression. The implementation of these operations is identical to the above-described implementation for calculating expressions. This is why we believe the reader will be able to easily handle it.\nAfter finishing the result calculation for our sub-expression, we modify the result of the whole expression depending on the value of the expressionOperator.\n\nFormatting The Output\nThe only output that the program must print on the console is the result of solving the expression with an accuracy of up to two symbols after the decimal point. How can we format the output this way? We will leave the answer to this question to the reader.\nTesting in The Judge System\nTest your solution here: https://judge.softuni.org/Contests/Practice/Index/942#1.\nProblem: Bulls and Cows\nWe all know the game called \"Bulls and Cows\"  (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulls_and_cows). Upon having a particular 4-digit secret number and a 4-digit suggested number, the following rules are applied:\n\nIf a digit in the suggested number matches a digit in the secret number and is located at the same position, we have a bull.\nIf a digit in the suggested number matches a digit in the secret number but is located at a different position, we have a cow.\n\n\n\n\nSecret number\n1\n4\n8\n1\nComment\n\n\n\n\nSuggested number\n8\n8\n1\n1\nBulls = 1Cows = 2\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSecret number\n2\n2\n4\n1\nComment\n\n\n\n\nSuggested number\n9\n9\n2\n4\nBulls = 0Cows = 2\n\n\n\nUpon having a particular secret number and the bulls and cows pertaining to it, our task is to find all possible suggested numbers in ascending order.\nIf there are no suggested numbers that match the criteria provided from the console, we must print \"No\".\nInput Data\nOur input data consists of 3 arguments: \n\nThe first contains the secret number.\nThe second contains the number of bulls.\nThe third contains the number of cows.\n\nThe input data will always be valid. There is no need to verify them.\nOutput Data\nThe output data must be printed on the console.\nThe output must consist of a single line, holding all suggested numbers, space-separated.\nIf there are no suggested numbers that match the criteria provided from the console, we must print “No”.\nConstraints\n\nThe secret number will always consist of 4 digits in the range [1..9]. [TODO: Digits is good to be unique. If we have a secret number 2132 and suggestion 8762 We have 1 bull and 1 cow for 1 digit.]\nThe number of cows and bulls will always be in the range [0..9]. [TODO: Is there a point to have cows and bulls from 0..9? When will we have 5 bulls and 7 cows? The input must be valid.]\nAllowed execution time: 0.15 seconds.\nAllowed memory: 16 MB.\n\nSample Input and Output\n\n\n\nInput\nOutput\n\n\n\n\n222821\n1222 2122 2212 2232 2242 2252 2262 2272 2281 2283 2284 2285 2286 2287 2289 2292 2322 2422 2522 2622 2722 2821 2823 2824 2825 2826 2827 2829 2922 3222 4222 5222 6222 7222 8221 8223 8224 8225 8226 8227 8229 9222\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInput\nOutput\n\n\n\n\n123430\n1134 1214 1224 1231 1232 1233 1235 1236 1237 1238 1239 1244 1254 1264 1274 1284 1294 1334 1434 1534 1634 1734 1834 1934 2234 3234 4234 5234 6234 7234 8234 9234\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInput\nOutput\n\n\n\n\n123431\nNo\n\n\n\nHints and Guidelines\nBecause our input comes directly as an argument of our function we can do the followings steps to complete our task:\n\nWe will generate all possible four-digit combinations (candidates for verification).\nFor each generated combination we will calculate how many bulls and how many cows it has according to the secret number. Upon matching the needed bulls and cows, we will print the combination.\n\nAlgorithm for Solving The Problem\nBefore starting to write the algorithm for solving our problem, we must declare a flag that indicates whether a solution is found:\n\nIf after finishing our algorithm this flag is still false, then we will print No on the console, as specified in the requirements.\n\nLet's start analyzing our problem. What we need to do is analyze all numbers from 1111 to 9999, excluding those that contain zeroes (for example 9011, 3401, etc. are invalid). What is the easiest way to generate all these numbers? We will use nested loops. As we have a 4-digit number, we will have 4 nested loops, as each of them will generate an individual digit in our number for testing.\nAn alternative solution is to go through all the numbers from 1111 to 999 with a loop and ignore every number with '0' inside it. But this will change the code, which we will do below.\n\nThanks to these loops, we have access to every digit of all numbers that we need to check. Our next step is to separate the secret number into digits. This can be achieved very easily using a combination of integer division and modular division.\n\nHow? When we divide we get a decimal number. We can use Math.floor(…) then divide it with a remainder operator(%) by 10, or we can cast the number with  parseInt(…).\nIn the example above we remove the fractional part.\nOnly two last steps remain until we start analyzing how many cows and bulls there are in a particular number. Accordingly, the first one is the declaration of counter variables in the nested loops, to count the cows and bulls for the current number. The second step is to make copies of the digits of the current number that we will analyze, to prevent problems upon working with nested loops, in case we make changes to them.\n\nWe are ready to start analyzing the generated numbers. What logic can we use? The easiest way to check how many cows and bulls there are inside a number is via a sequence of if-else conditions. Yes, this is not the most optimal way, but to stick to what is covered in the current book, we will use this approach.\nWhat conditions do we need?\nThe condition for the bulls is very simple – we check whether the first digit of the generated number matches the same digit in the secret number. We remove the digits that are already checked to avoid repetitions of bulls and cows.\n\nWe repeat the action for the second, third, and fourth digits. \nOur conditional statement for cows can be done by this method - we check if the first digit from the generated number matches with the second, the third, or the fourth digit of the secret number. We can combine all conditional statements inside one condition, know that in the three cases we have a cow, but we won't know which digit to remove. That's why we type it one by one:\n\nAfter that, we sequentially check whether the second digit of the generated number matches the first one, the third one, or the fourth digit of the secret number; whether the third digit of the generated number matches the first one, the second one, or the fourth digit of the secret number; and finally, we check whether the fourth digit of the generated number matches the first one, the second one or the third digit of the secret number.\nPrinting The Output\nAfter completing all conditions, we just need to check whether the bulls and cows in the currently generated number match the desired bulls and cows read from the console. If this is true, we print the current number on the console.\n\nTesting in The Judge System\nTest your solution here: https://judge.softuni.org/Contests/Practice/Index/942#2.\n"},"chapter-10-functions.html":{"url":"chapter-10-functions.html","title":"10. Functions","keywords":"","body":"Chapter 10. Functions\nJavaScript is a well-known functional language for programming. As the name hints, functions are an extremely important part of the language. \nIn this chapter, we will introduce you to functions and you will learn their definition, as well as what their base concepts are while working with them. You will learn why it's a good practice to use them, how to define and declare them. We will also introduce you to the parameters and return value of a function, as well as how to use that return value. In the end, we will peek at best practices when using functions.\nWhat is a \"Function\"?\nUntil this moment, we have found out that while writing a programming code for an exercise, separating the exercise into different parts, favors us a lot. Every part is responsible for a corresponding action and by doing so it's easier to solve the problem, and the readability and the debugging of the code are better.\nA block of code designed to perform a particular task and which we have separated logically is called function. Functions – slices of code, that are named by us in a specific way. They can be called numerous times when we need them, and they will be run that many times as we want to.\nOne function can be called that many times, as we think is needed for solving a problem. That saves us from repeating the same code and reduces the opportunities of making a mistake while editing the repeated code. \nSimple Functions\nSimple functions are responsible for running a specific action, that will help us solve a problem. Those actions can be printing a string on the console, doing a conditional statement, doing a loop, etc.\nLet's see an example of a simple function:\n\nThis function has the task to print a header, which is a series of the symbol -. Because of this, the name of the function is printHeader. The round brackets ( and ) are always after the name, no matter how we have named the functions. Later we will take a look at how we have to name a function we are working with. For now, we will only say that the name of the function must define the action that is doing.\nThe body of the function consists of programming code, which is located between the curly brackets { and }. Between them, we place code, that will solve our problem, described by the name of the function.\nWhy Should We Use Functions?\nUp to this moment, we have found out that, functions help us with separating long exercises into smaller parts, which leads to a simple solution of the corresponding problem. This makes our program, not just well structured, easy readable but also more understandable.\nUsing functions we escape repeating of programming code. Repeating code is a bad practice because it makes harder maintenance for the programmer to do which leads to errors. If one part of code exists in our program more than once and we have to fix it, we will have to change every occurrence of repeating code. The probability of us forgetting one of the repeated places is high, which will lead to incorrect behavior of our program. This is exactly why it's a good practice to define a fragment that will be used more than once as a separate function.\nFunctions offer us a good method to use code several times. With solving more and more exercises, we will conclude that using already defined functions saves us a lot of time and effort.\nDeclaring Functions\nIn JavaScript language we can define functions everywhere, using the same way we define variables. Declaring represents the registration of a function inside a program and to be recognized inside it.\nJavaScript isn't a strongly typed language. That's why when we declare a function it doesn't have a type(string, number, array, etc.), which other programming language methods have.\nThere are two ways, to declare a function in JavaScript - function declaration and Function expression.\nFunction Declaration\nWith the next example, we will take a look at the required elements inside a function, using function declaration.\n\n\nKeyword function. We start by using the keyword function, with which we define that there will be declared a function. We name it keyword because it is reserved in the JavaScript language. We can't have a variable that is named function exactly because it is reserved.\nName of the function.  The name of the function is defined by us and we must never forget that it must define the task it is doing. In the example, the name getSquare tells us that the task of this function is to find the area of a square.\nList of parameters. We declare them between ( and ) brackets, which we type after the name of the function. Here we list a series of parameters, which the function will use. We can have only one parameter, more than one parameter or we can leave it empty. If there are no parameters we will only type the brackets (). In the current example, the parameter is only the n.\nBody of the function. It is declared between  { and } brackets which we type after the closing bracket ). In our body of the function, we define all operations, that we want our function to do, using code. We also describe the algorithm by which the function will solve the given problem. We achieve the logic of the function. In the current example, we calculate the area of the square using n * n.\n\nWhen declaring functions it is important to follow the sequence of the fundamental elements - first Keyword function then Name of function, List of parameters surrounded by round brackets (), Body of the function surrounded by curly brackets {}.\nFunction Expression\nWith the next example, we will take a look at the required elements in the declaration of an expression function. It is similar to function declaration which we have already viewed and it can be said that it's a set of declaring a variable and declaring a declaration function.\n\n\nKeyword let. We will start with using the keyword let, with which we will declare a declaration of a variable.\nName of the variable. The name of the variable is decided by us. In the example, the name is getSquare which tells us that the task of this function is to calculate the area of the square.\nDeclaration of a function. Using the same structure that we have learned in function declaration -  first Keyword function then Name of function, List of parameters surrounded by round brackets (), Body of the function surrounded by curly brackets {}. The difference, in this case, is that Name of a function is not necessary, but it is recommended to get used to writing the name. In the example, the program will work without problems even if we don't type getSquareFunc. If we don't type the name, the function will become anonymous.\n\nWhen we declare a variable in the body of a function (using the keyword let or const). We call it a local variable for the function. The scope in which it exists and can be used is from the row it is defined to the end of the closing bracket } of the function. That scope is called variable scope.\nFunction Declaration or Function Expression\nThe difference between Function declaration and Function expression is very simple. All functions declared by function declaration are loaded in the memory of a program before it is started. However, when we are using function expression the program will know and run the function only when it has come to it.\nIn theory, this means that we can call a function that is declared with function declaration even before it was declared in the previous rows. If we try to use function expression the program will throw an error that the function is not declared yet.\nInvoking a Function\nInvoking a function is the start of the execution of a code that is located inside the body of a function. We call it by typing the name of the function followed by () and ; to end the row. Here is an example:\n\nThis function can be called from different points in our program. One of the ways to be called is to be called from the global scope.\n\nA Function can be invoked from the body of another function which is not the global scope of our program.\n\nA Function can be called from its own body. This is called recursion and you can find more about it on Wikipedia) or google it.\nProblem: Blank Receipt\nWrite a function, that prints an empty cash receipt. The function must call another three functions: one to print the title, one for the main part, and the last for the bottom part.\n\n\n\nPart of cash receipt\nText\n\n\n\n\nUpper part\nCASH RECEIPT------------------------------\n\n\nMiddle part\nCharged to____________________Received by___________________\n\n\nBottom part\n------------------------------(c) SoftUni\n\n\n\nSample Input and Output\n\n\n\nInput\nOutput\n\n\n\n\nNone\nCASH RECEIPT------------------------------Charged to____________________Received by___________________------------------------------(c) SoftUni\n\n\n\nHints and Guidelines\nOur first step is to create a function for creating a title. We should give it a short descriptive name. For example: printReceiptHeader. In the body we will write the following code:\n\nIn a like manner, we will create another two functions to print the middle part of the receipt (body) printReceiptBody and to print the bottom part of the receipt (footer printReceiptFooter.\nAfter this we will set one more function* which will call the other three functions which we have written so far:\n\nIn the end, we will invoke printReceipt from the global scope of our program:\n\nTesting in The Judge System\nThe program with a total of four functions that call one another is ready and we can run and debug it. After that, we will send it for test in the Judge system: https://judge.softuni.org/Contests/Practice/Index/943#0.\nFunctions with Parameters\nWhen we are dealing with a given task the function we are using needs additional information which the result depends on. Exactly this information are the parameters of the functions and the behavior of a program depends on.\nUsing Parameters Inside a Function\nIf the function requires input data, it is passed inside () brackets. The order of function parameters must match the order of the function arguments when declaring and invoking the function. Parameters can be zero, one, or more. When declaring the parameters we divide them with a comma ,.\nDeclaring function printNumbers(...) and the list of parameters which the programs need to work correctly will look like this:\n\nAfter this, we invoke the function, and we give it the corresponding function arguments:\n\nWhen declaring function parameters we should check if every parameter has a name. It's also important when we invoke a function we should always pass values in the order that they were declared. In the previous example, the variable start will be passed to the first element (in our case the number 5). The variable end will have the next number which is 10.\nIt's important to point out that in the programming language JavaScript declaring a function with a given number of parameters doesn't force us to invoke a function with the same number of parameters. We can invoke the function by giving it more or fewer parameters than needed and it won't cause an error.\nLet's look at this example:\n\nIn this example, we call the function  printNumbers(...) and we give 4 instead of the declared 2 parameters. All unnecessary parameters will be ignored. These are the numbers 15 and 20. They won't go to the function because the function doesn't have a declared parameter that will get them.\nLet's look at another example:\n\nIn this example, we call the function printNumbers(...) but this time we give only 1 parameter instead of the declared 2 parameters. All parameters that are not set as values will automatically get undefined values. In our case the variable.\nProblem: Sign of Integer Number\nCreate a function that checks if a number is a positive or negative number.\nSample Input and Output\n\n\n\nInput\nOutput\n\n\n\n\n2\nThe number 2 is positive.\n\n\n-5\nThe number -5 is negative.\n\n\n0\nThe number 0 is zero.\n\n\n\nHints and Guidelines\nOur first step is declaring a function and giving it describing name - printSign. This function will only have one parameter:\n\nOur next step is implementing logic by which our program will check if the number is positive or negative. From the example, we can see that there are 3 cases:  if the number is bigger and smaller than zero or if it's zero. We will make three conditional statements in the body of our function.\nOur next step is to call the function we have created:\n\nTesting in The Judge System\nTest your solution here: https://judge.softuni.org/Contests/Practice/Index/943#1.\nOptional Parameters\nJavaScript programming language supports optional parameters. They allow skipping of parameters when calling a function. We declare them by providing default values in the description of the parameter.\nOur next example shows the use of optional parameters:\n\nprintNumbers(...) can be invoked in different ways:\n\nWhen we are not setting value for the parameter, he will get the value that we have given him when declaring the function.\nProblem: Printing Triangle\nCreate a function that will create a triangle as shown in the example.\nSample Input and Output\n\n\n\nInput\nOutPut\nInput\nOutPut\n\n\n\n\n3\n11 21 2 31 21\n4\n11 21 2 31 2 3 4 1 2 31 21\n\n\n\nHints and Guidelines\nWe choose a name according to the task it will do. For example, printLine and we implement it:\n\nFrom drawing on console exercises we remember that it's a good practice to divide the figure into different parts. We will divide the triangle into 3 parts - upper, middle, and bottom.\nOur next step is to print the upper body of the triangle with a loop:\n\nAfter that, we will print the middle part:\n\nIn the end, we will print the bottom part from the triangle but this time with a reverse loop.\n\nTesting in The Judge System\nTest your solution here: https://judge.softuni.org/Contests/Practice/Index/943#2.\nProblem: Draw a Filled Square\nDraw a square with side n, as shown in the example.\nSample Input and Output\n\n\n\nInput\nOutput\nInput\nOutput\n\n\n\n\n4\n---------\\/\\/\\/--\\/\\/\\/---------\n5\n-----------\\/\\/\\/\\/--\\/\\/\\/\\/--\\/\\/\\/\\/-----------\n\n\n\nHints and Guidelines\nWe create a function that prints the first and last row because they are the same. We shouldn't forget that we have to give him a corresponding name and set as a parameter the length of the side. We will use the built-in function repeat(...):\n\nOur next step is to create a function that will draw on the console the middle rows. Again we set a descriptive name such as printMiddleRow.\n\nIn the end, we invoke the declared functions to draw the whole square:\n\nTesting in The Judge System\nTest your solution here: https://judge.softuni.org/Contests/Practice/Index/943#3.\nReturn Result From a Function\nUp to this point, we have viewed functions that do a specific task. For example printing a text, number, or a figure on the console. There is another type of function that can return a result from their task. We can return a result of the multiplication of two numbers. We will look at this type of function in this part.\nThe Operator return\nTo get a result from a function we use the operator return. He must be used inside the body of a function. The return will tell the program to stop the execution of the function and return a corresponding value. This value is defined after the return word. \nIn the example underneath we have a function that gets the first and last name as parameters. Then it combines them and returns the full name.\n\nThere are cases in which return can be called from different places inside the function, but only if the conditions are met. \nIn the example below, we have a function that compares 2 numbers and returns the result which can be  -1, 0, or 1 if the first argument is smaller, equal, or bigger than the second argument. The function uses the operator return on 3 different places. It returns different values depending on the logic of the code. \n\nCode After a return is Unreachable\nWhen the return operator is located inside a conditional statement such as if, after the statement in the same block, we must not have rows with code because Visual Studio Code will display a warning telling us that it had found an unreachable code.\n\nThe operator return can be also used without a specific value. In this case, the function will be terminated and the return value will be undefined.\n\nIn programming, we can't have 2 times the operator return one after another because the first return won't allow us to use the second. Sometimes programmers joke\nwith the phrase type return; return; and let's go home”, to explain that the logic of the program is wrongly typed.\n\n\nUsing The return Value of a Function\nAfter a function is executed and has returned a value, we can use the value in several ways.\nThe first is to assign the result to a variable:\n\nThe second is to be used inside an expression:\n\nThe third is to pass the result from one function to another function:\n\nProblem: Calculate Triangle Area\nWrite a function that finds the area of a triangle by given side and altitude and then returns the area.\nSample Input and Output\n\n\n\nInput\nOutput\n\n\n\n\n34\n6\n\n\n\nHints and Guidelines\nWe Create a function with a descriptive name.\n\nOur next step is to call the new function and record the returned value inside another variable.\n\nTesting in The Judge System\nTest your solution here: https://judge.softuni.org/Contests/Practice/Index/943#4.\nProblem: Math Power\nWrite a function that calculates and returns the result the power of a number. \nSample Input and Output\n\n\n\nInput\nOutput\nInput\nOutput\n\n\n\n\n28\n256\n34\n81\n\n\n\nHints and Guidelines\nOur first step is again to create a function that will get 2 parameters (base and exponent(power)). Then the function will return the result.  \n\nAfter we have done our calculations, all we are left to do is invoke the function.\nTesting in The Judge System\nTest your solution here: https://judge.softuni.org/Contests/Practice/Index/943#5.\nFunctions, Returning Multiple Values\nIn practice, there are some cases in which we need a function that returns more than one element as a result. In the JavaScript language, there are 2 ways of doing that. They are with destruction and by returning an object.\nDestruction\nWhen we want a function to return more than one value, we use the keyword return and after that, we list all the values we want to return between [, ] brackets:\n\nAfter that to get the returned values using the square brackets we list a new set of variables that will get the returned values. We must follow the order we have returned them in the function.\n\nIn the upper example, the variable name  will get the value \"John Doe\", which is the first of the returned function of getNames, and fullName will get \"John Silver Doe*\" which is second.\nObjects\nThis way is very similar to the previous one. The only difference is that we don't just list all the values which we want to return. We give them names. Objects are extremely important and a big part of the JavaScript language. For now, it's enough for us to know that they are declared with curly brackets { } and we type the name of the value (it's called a key). After the name, we type :  followed by a value. We divide different key-value pairs with ,. \n\nIn this example, we return an object which holds 2 values - name and fullName. \n\nHere the variable  personNames will get all the returns values. By calling .name and .fullName we get the returned values:   \n\nVariants of a Function\nIn many programming languages, one function can be declared as different variants with the same name but different parameters. This is known as method overloading. For good or bad JavaScript, language doesn't support this.\nWhen we declare two or more functions with the same names, our program will use the last declared. Declaring the second function with the same name removes the old function and overrides the new one in that place. \nNested Functions\nLet's take a look at this example:\n\nWhat is a Local Function?\nWe see that in the previous example, solve() function has another declared function sum(). This nested function is called a local function. Local functions can be declared in every other function.\nWhy Should We Use Local Functions?\nWith time and practice we will find out that when we type code, we often need functions, which\nwe might need only once or another function is becoming too long. We have already said that when one function has too many rows of code it is very hard to read, support, and understand. In those cases, we can declare another function that we will use even only once. This helps the code to be cleaner and reduces the chance of making a mistake in the programming code.\nDeclaring Local Functions\nLet's look again at the previous example\n\nIn this example sum() is local function because it's nested inside solve() function. This means that sum() can be  called only inside solve() function because it's only declared inside it.\nLocal functions have access to variables, which are declared in the same or upper level from them. Our next example shows how this happens.\n\nThis feature of nested functions makes them convenient helpers when solving a task. They save time and code by not having to pass values to parameters and variables.\nNaming Functions. Best Practices For Working With Functions.\nIn this part, we will take a look at some of the best practices for writing functions that are connected to an arrangement of a code and its structure. \nNaming Functions\nWhen we name a function it's recommended to use logical names. This is good because every function must correspond to a specific part of our problem. We must take into consideration the task which the function will do. This is why it's a good practice for the name to describe the purpose of the function.\nIt is required for the name of the function to start with a small letter and to be a verb or a combination of a verb and a noun. Formatting the names must be done following Lower Camel Case convention - every word except the first to start with an upper letter. Round brackets \n( and ) are always after the name of the function.\nEvery function must do an independent task and the name must describe its role.\nHere are some examples of correctly named functions:\n\nfindStudent\nloadReport\nsine\n\nSome examples of badly named functions:\n\nmethod1\ndoSomething\nhandleStuff\nsampleMethod\ndirtyHack\nFindStudent\nLoadReport\n\nIf we can't come up with a good name it's probably because our function does more than one job or it doesn't have a clear task. We must think of a way to divide the function into different functions.\nNaming Parameters of Functions\nWhen naming parameters of functions, the same rules of naming functions apply to them.\nThe only difference is that the name of the parameters should be nouns or a set of a noun and an adjective. It's a good practice that the name of the parameter should indicate what type of unit is used when working with it.\nHere are some examples of correctly named parameters of functions:\n\nfirstName\nreport\nspeedKmH\nusersList\nfontSizeInPixels\nfont\n\nSome examples of incorrectly named parameters: \n\np\np1\np2\npopulate\nLastName\nlast_name\n\nGood Practices for Working With Functions\nWe must keep in mind that a function must do only one specific task. If this can't be achieved, then we must come up with a way to divide the functionality into different parts.\nAs we have already said the name must be clear and descriptive. Another good practice is to avoid functions that are longer than our screen. If this happens it's recommended to split the function into smaller ones as shown in the example below.\n\nStructure and Formatting of The Code\nWhen writing functions we must keep in mind to follow a correct indication (move more inward blocks of the code).\nHere are some examples of correctly formatted JavaScript code:\n\nSome examples of incorrectly formatted JavaScript code:\n\nWhen the headline row of the function is too long, it's recommended to be split into several rows, and every row after the first should be moved 2 tabulations to right (for clear readability).\n\nAnother good practice is to leave an empty row between functions, after loops, and conditional statements. You should always try to avoid writing long rows and complicated expressions.\nOver time you will find out that improves the readability and saves time.\nWe recommend you to always use curly brackets for the body of conditional statements and loops. The brackets don't just improve the readability but also reduce the possibility of making a mistake.\nWhat Have We Learned from This Chapter?\nIn this chapter we have learned base concepts about working with functions:\n\nLearned that the goal of a function is to split programs with many rows to code with smaller and shorter parts.\nComprehended the idea of the structure of functions and how to declare and invoke them by their name.\nLooked into different examples of functions with parameters and how to use them in our program.\nLearned what is signature and return value of the function as well as what is the role of the return operator.\nStudied good practices for working with functions, how to name them and their parameters and how to format our code and others.\n\nProblems\nTo improve what we have learned we will solve a few exercises. In them, it is required to write functions with specific functionality and then call it with values as shown in the example.\nProblem: Hello, Name!\nWrite a function that takes a name as a parameter and prints on the console \"Hello, {name}!\".\nSample Input and Output\n\n\n\nInput\nOutput\n\n\n\n\nPeter\nHello, Peter!\n\n\n\nHints and Guidelines\nDefine a function printName(name) and implement it.

While the number isn't 0 we will check if the index matches our input value. If it matches we will return the number of the index (number % 10). If it doesn't match anything we will remove the last digit of the number (number = number / 10). We must follow which digit we check in the conditional statement (starting from left to right from 1). When we find the digit we will return the index.\nTesting in The Judge System\nTest your solution here: https://judge.softuni.org/Contests/Practice/Index/943#10.\nProblem: Integer to Base\nWrite a function integerToBase(number, toBase), which takes as parameters an integer and a base of a numeral system and returns the integer converted to the given numeral system.

For each message read a few lines. Each message starts with messageType: “success”, “warning” or “error”:\n\nWhen messageType is “success” read operation + message (each from a new line).\nWhen messageType is a “warning” read-only message (from a new line).\nWhen messageType is “error” read operation + message + errorCode (each from a new line).\n\nPrint on the console each read message formatted depending on its messageType. After the headline of the message print as much =, as the length of the said headline and print an empty line after each message (to understand in detail look at the examples). \nThe problem should be solved by defining four functions: showSuccessMessage(), showWarningMessage(), showErrorMessage() and processMessage(), so that only the last function is invoked by the Main() function:\n\nSample Input and Output\n\n\n\nInput\nOutput\n\n\n\n\n4errorcredit card purchaseInvalid customer address500warningEmail not confirmedsuccessuser registrationUser registered successfullywarningCustomer has not email assigned\nError: Failed to execute credit card purchase.==============================================Reason: Invalid customer address.Error code: 500.Warning: Email not confirmed.=============================Successfully executed user registration.========================================User registered successfully.Warning: Customer has no email assigned.=========================================\n\n\n\nHints and Guidelines\nDefine and implement the four shown functions. After that call processMessage(...) from the main solve(...) function.\n\nIn processMessage() read the type of message from the console and according to the read, type read the rest of the data (one, two, or three more lines). After that invoke the function for printing the given type of message.\nTesting in The Judge System\nTest your solution here: https://judge.softuni.org/Contests/Practice/Index/943#12.\nProblem: * Numbers to Words\nWrite a function letterize(number), which reads an integer and prints it in words in English according to the conditions below:\n\nPrint in words the hundreds, the tens, and the ones (and the eventual minus) according to the rules of the English language.\nIf the number is larger than 999, you must print \"too large\".\nIf the number is smaller than -999, you must print \"too small\".\nIf the number is negative, you must print \"minus\" before it.\nIf the number is not built up of three digits, you shouldn't print it.\n\nSample Input and Output\n\n\n\nInput\nOutput\nInput\nOutput\n\n\n\n\n3999-4201020\nnine-hundred and ninety nineminus four-hundred and twentytoo large\n215350\nfifteenthree-hundred and fifty\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInput\nOutput\nInput\nOutput\n\n\n\n\n4311418509-9945\nthree-hundred and elevenfour-hundred and eighteenfive-hundred and ninetoo small\n35001239\nfive-hundredone-hundred and twenty-threenine\n\n\n\nHints and Guidelines\nWe can first print the hundreds as a text – (the number / 100) % 10, after that the tens – (the number / 10) % 10 and at the end the ones – (the number % 10).\nThe first special case is when the number is exactly rounded to 100 (e.g. 100, 200, 300, etc). In this case we print \"one-hundred\", \"two-hundred\", \"three-hundred\" etc.\nThe second special case is when the number formed by the last two digits of the input number is less than 10 (e.g. 101, 305, 609, etc...). In this case, we print \"one-hundred and one\", \"three-hundred and five\", \"six-hundred and nine\" etc.\nThe third special case is when the number formed by the last two digits of the input number is larger than 10 and smaller than 20 (e.g. 111, 814, 919, etc). In this case, we print \"one-hundred and eleven\", \"eight-hundred and fourteen\", \"nine-hundred and nineteen\" etc.\nTesting in The Judge System\nTest your solution here: https://judge.softuni.org/Contests/Practice/Index/943#13.\nProblem: * String Encryption\nWrite a function encrypt(char letter), which encrypts a given letter in the following way:\n\nIt takes the first and the last digit from the ASCII code of the letter and concatenates them into a string, which will represent the result. \nAt the beginning of the string, which represents the result, we will insert the symbol which matches the following condition:\nASCII code of the letter + the last digit of the ASCII code of the letter.\n\n\nAfter that at the end of the string, which represents the result, you concatenate the character which matches the following condition:\nASCII code of the letter - the first digit of the ASCII code of the letter.\n\n\nThe function should return the encrypted string.\n\nExample:\n\nj → p16i\nASCII code of j is 106 → First digit – 1, last digit – 6.\nWe concatenate the first and the last digit → 16.\nAt the beginning of the string, which represents the result, concatenate the symbol, which you get from the sum of the ASCII code + the last digit → 106 + 6 → 112 → p.\nAt the end of the string, which represents the result, concatenate the symbol, which you get from subtracting the ASCII code – the first digit → 106 - 1 → 105 → i.\n\n\n\nUsing the function shown above, write a function solve(...) which takes a sequence of characters, encrypts them, and prints the result on one line. The input data will always be valid. The Main function must read the data given by the user – an integer n, followed by a character for each of the following n lines. Encrypt the symbols and add them to the encrypted string. In the end, as a result, you must print an encrypted string as in the following example.\nExample:\n\nS, o, f, t, U, n, i → V83Kp11nh12ez16sZ85Mn10mn15h\n\nSample Input and Output\n\n\n\nInput\nOutput\n\n\n\n\n7SoftUni\nV83Kp11nh12ez16sZ85Mn10mn15h\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInput\nOutput\n\n\n\n\n7BiraHax\nH66\n\n\n\nHints and Guidelines\nOur variable result in which we will save the value of the result we will give the initial value \"\". We must recur a loop n times so that in each iteration we will add the encrypted symbol to the result string. \nTo find the first and the last digit of the ASCII code, we will use the same algorithm that we used to solve \"Integer to Base\".\nTesting in The Judge System\nTest your solution here: https://judge.softuni.org/Contests/Practice/Index/943#14.\n"},"chapter-11-tricks-and-hacks.html":{"url":"chapter-11-tricks-and-hacks.html","title":"11. Tricks and Hacks","keywords":"","body":"Chapter 11. Tricks and Hacks\nIn the current chapter, we are going to see some tricks, hacks, and techniques, which will make our work with JavaScript easier in the Visual Studio Code IDE. In particular, we will see:\n\nHow to properly format our code.\nConventions for naming elements in the code.\nSome keyboard shortcuts.\nSome code snippets.\nTechniques to debug our code.\n\nCode Formatting\nThe right formatting of our code will make it easier to read and understand in case someone else needs to work with it. This is important because in practice we will need to work in a team with other people and it is highly important to write our code in a way that our colleagues can quickly understand it.\nThere are some defined rules for correct formatting of the code, which are collected in one place and are called conventions. The conventions are a group of rules, generally accepted by the programmers using a given language, which are massively used. These conventions help to build norms in given languages - what is the best way to write and what are the good practices. It is accepted that if a programmer follows them then his code is easy to read and understand.\nThe JavaScript language is created by Brendan Eich as part of the development of one of the first browsers Netscape. The basic constructions and basic syntax are intentionally similar to Java, to reduce the learning effort. Moreover, similar conventions are even used to write and format the code. You should know that, even if you do not follow the imposed conventions, the code will work (as long as it is written correctly), but simply will not be easy to understand. Of course, this is not fatal on a base level, but the faster you get used to writing quality code, the better.\nThe rules that are used for writing JavaScipt can be found in many sources. The official rules, etc. JavaScript code conventions are very well described in the article \"Coding style\" in the documentation of \"Mozilla\": https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Developer_guide/Coding_Style. It is important, to note that in the examples, we have given so far and will give in the future in this book, we are guided mainly by it.\nFor code formatting curly braces {} to be opened on the same line and to be closed just below the construction, to which they refer, as in the example below.\nif (someCondition) {\n    console.log(\"Inside the if statement\");\n}\n\nYou can see that the command console.log(…) in the example is offset by 4 white spaces(one tab), which is also recommended by the documentation. If given construction with curly brackets is offset by one tab, then the curly brackets {} must be at the beginning of the construction, as in the example below:\nif (someCondition) {\n   if (anotherCondition) {\n       console.log(\"Inside the if statement\");\n   }\n}\n\nThis is an example of a badly formatted code according to the accepted conventions for writing code in JavaScript:\nif(someCondition)\n{\nconsole.log(\"Inside the if statement\");}\n\nThe first thing we can notice is the curly braces {}. The first (opening) bracket must be exactly next to the if condition, and the second (closing) bracket - under the command console.log(…), on a separate blank line. In addition, the command inside the if construction must be offset by 4 white spaces(one tab). Immediately after the keyword if and before the condition of the check, a space is left.\nThe same rule applies to for loops, as well as any other constructions with curly braces {}. Here are some more examples:\nCorrect:\nfor (let i = 0; i \nWrong:\nfor(let i=0;i\nFor your comfort, there are keyboard shortcuts in Visual Studio Code, which we will explain later in this chapter, but for now, we are interested in the following combinations for formatting the code in the whole document:\n\nFor Windows [Shift + Alt + F]\nFor Mac [Shift + Option + F]\nFor Ubuntu [Ctrl + Shift + I]\n\nLet's use the wrongly formatted example from earlier:\nfor(let i=0;i\nIf we press [Shift + Alt + F], which is our combination to format the entire document, we will get code formatted according to generally accepted JavaScript conventions. \nHowever, automatic formatting does not affect the naming of our variables, which we have to take care of ourselves. It is accepted for variables to begin always with a lowercase letter and contain lowercase letters, with each subsequent word in them beginning with a capital letter (this naming is also known as the camelCase convention).\n\nWe must be aware of uppercase and lowercase letters because JavaScript makes a difference between them. For example age and Age are different variables.\nVariable names cannot match a JavaScript keyword, for example, let is an invalid variable name. The official or, etc. keyword phrases are just words that are part of the syntax of JavaScript and for this reason, they are reserved and cannot be used as names of our variables. Through these words, we have the opportunity to build our programs. As an example of such words can be given the already used: for, while, do, if, else, let, etc. You can see a full list of these reserved phrases here: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Lexical_grammar#Keywords\n\n\nAlthough using the symbol _ in the manes of variables is allowed, in JavaScript it is not recommended and is considered a bad style of naming.\n\n\nHere are some examples for well-named variables:\n\nfirstName\nage\nstartIndex\nlastNegativeNumberIndex\n\nHere are some examples for badly named variables, even though the names are correct according to the JavaScript language:\n\n_firstName (start with '_')\nlast_name (contains '_')\nAGE (written in uppercase)\nStart_Index (starts with an uppercase letter and contains '_')\nlastNegativeNumber_Index (contains '_')\n\nAt a first look all these rules can seem meaningless and unnecessary, but with time passed and experience gaining you will see the need for conventions for writing quality code, to be able to work more easily and faster in a team. You will understand that the work with a code, which is written without complying with any rules for code quality, is annoying.\nShortcuts in Visual Studio Code\nIn the previous section, we mentioned some of the combinations, that are used for formatting code. One of them [Shift + Alt + F] is used for formatting the whole code in a file, and others did the same thing but on a different operating system. These combinations are called shortcuts and now we will give more thorough information about them.\nShortcuts are combinations, that give us the ability to perform some actions easier and faster, and each software development environment has its shortcuts, although most are repetitive. We will now look at some of the shortcuts in Visual Studio Code. The listed keyboard shortcuts work for sure and have been tested on Windows. The idea is to show you that this exists, it is easy to use and when needed, you can always find what you need for every operating system.\n\n\n\nCombination\nAction\n\n\n\n\n[CTRL + F]\nThe combination opens the search window, by which we can search in our code.\n\n\n[CTRL + /]\nComments part of our code and accordingly removes the comment which is already commented.\n\n\n[CTRL + Z]\nBrings back one change (so-called Undo).\n\n\n[CTRL + Y]\nThe combination is opposite of [CTRL + Z] (the so-called Redo).\n\n\n[Shift + Alt + F]\nFormats the code according to the default conventions.\n\n\n[CTRL + Backspace]\nDeletes the word to the left of the cursor.\n\n\n[CTRL + Del]\nDeletes the word to the right of the cursor.\n\n\n[CTRL + K S]\nSaves all files in the project.\n\n\n[CTRL + S]\nSaves the current file.\n\n\n\nMore about the shortcuts in Visual Studio Code can be found here: https://code.visualstudio.com/shortcuts/keyboard-shortcuts-windows.pdf. \nIf you feel confident enough about your shortcut skills, open Visual Studio Code and press [CTRL + K + S] (note that this is different from [CTRL + K S], where Ctrl and K are pressed simultaneously, and S after that), which will open a window in the development environment itself, which contains a complete list of all possible keys combinations in the world of Visual Studio Code. Moreover, even from there, you will be able to make changes to existing keyboard shortcuts:\n\nDo not hesitate, apply what you have learned now and use the keyboard shortcuts that you think will help you in writing your programs!\nCode Snippets (Code Snippets)\nIn Visual Studio Code there are the so-called code snippets (code snippets), which write a block of code by using a code template. This useful option is not enabled by default. You have to activate it yourself from [File -> Preferences -> Settings] (or just [Ctrl + Comma]), which opens window called User Settings. These are your settings, that you can easily change. Just add the following line between the opening and closing curly braces on the right side of the screen:\n\"editor.tabCompletion\": true\nAfter doing this, when you type \"for\" and press [Tab] + [Tab], the code of complete for loop is automatically generated in the body of our program. This is called \"unfolding a code snippet\". The snippet \"if\" + [Tab] + [Tab] works similarly. On the figure below you can see the \"for\" snippet in action:\n\nCreating Your Code Snippet\nIn this section, we are going to show you how to make your code snippet. We will see how to make a code snippet for json object. For a start, we will go to [File -> Preferences -> User Snippets], then a window will open from which you can choose for which programming language you will create a snippet, as shown in the picture:\n \nWe choose JavaScript from the drop-down menu and a window with a name will open JavaScript.json. This extension json is a special format for saving data, which is imposed in the ways of data transfer and storage. In addition, the json format can be used in our programs, as we will discuss later. The file looks like this:\n \nThe example we see by default is generating code to write to the console using the log key prefix. This code is just an example, and this template is embedded, but if it wasn't, it would look like the example.\nIn this example, you see a lot of unknown things, but do not worry, we will get familiar with them later. We now focus on the part \"Print to console\": and the code between opening and closing curly braces {}. What we see inside the parentheses is the content of a template. . Each template must contain a prefix, which is the short text that after pressing [Tab] + [Tab] will generate the template code in your program.\nThe second thing your template should have is a body, this is the most complex part of the template. This is the  code that will be generated  and in it, we can use variables, which are created with $1, and in place of the unit can be placed other text. The example uses a variable: \"console.log('$1');\".\nWe can use Tabstops, which simply place the cursor in certain places in the code, and between them can be navigated with tabs. They are created automatically by creating a variable. We can also use Placeholders, they are a type of Tabstops, but they can also contain some value, for example: ${1:myVal}.\nThere are also more complex configurations, but for begging these will do an excellent job.\nThe last part of the template is a description, which serves to add an explanation of what it does. Now let's try to make our template. We delete the given example and enter the following code:\n \nNow when we type json + [Tab] + [Tab] in an open JavaScript file in Visual Studio Code, our new snippet appears:\n \nFor those of you who are more interested in the topic, many of the big frameworks like Angular, React, etc. have their own templates that can be installed from the Extensions window. As the name suggests, a framework is a conceptual structure that helps us by giving us some things in advance, and also prevents us from making big mistakes by imposing certain restrictions. The main idea is to provide a complete solution in a given area, which can upgrade all components in this area. Some of the things you can get ready-made are these templates.\n \nCode Debugging Techniques\nDebugging plays an important role in the process of creating software, which is to allow us to follow the implementation of our program step by step. With this technique, we can follow the values of the local variables because they are changing during the execution of the program and remove possible errors (bugs). The process of debugging includes:\n\nFinding the problems (bugs).\nLocating the code, which causes the problems.\nCorrecting the code, which causes the problems so that the program works correctly.\nTesting, to make sure that the program works correctly after the corrections we have made.\n\nVisual Studio Code gives us a built-in debugger, thanks to which we can place breakpoints, at places we have chosen. When it reaches a breakpoint, the program stops running and allows step-by-step running of the remaining lines. Debugging allows us to get the details of the program and see where exactly the errors occur and what is the reason for this.\nTo demonstrate how to use the debugger, we will use the following program:\nfor (let i = 0; i \nWe will place a breakpoint on the method console.log(…). For this, we will need to move our cursor to the line, which prints on the console, and press [F9]. A breakpoint (the red point, just before the number on line 3), where the program will stop its execution:\n \nTo start the program in debug mode, we choose [Debug] -> [Start Debugging] or press [F5]:\n \nAfter starting the program, we can see that it stops executing at line 4, where we placed our breakpoint. The code in the current line is colored in yellow and we can run it step by step. To go to the next line e use the key [F10]. We can see that the code on the current line hasn't been executed yet. It will execute when we go ahead to the next line:\n \nFrom the Debug window, which opens with [View -> Debug] or with the keyboard shortcut [Ctrl + Shift + D], we can observe the changes in the local variables. \n \nA Guide for Tricks\nIn this section, we will briefly show tricks and techniques of programming with the JavaScript language, some of which are already mentioned in this book, which will be very useful, if you take a programming exam for beginners.\nRounding Numbers\nIn case we need to round numbers we can use one of the following methods:\n\nMath.round(…) - accepts 1 parameter - number, which we want to round. Rounding is performed according to the basic rule of rounding - if the decimal part is less than 5, rounding is down and vice versa, if it is greater than 5 - up:\n\nlet number = 5.439;\nconsole.log(Math.round(number));\n// This will print on the console \"5\"\nlet secondNumber = 5.539;\nconsole.log(Math.round(secondNumber));\n// This will print on the console \"6\"\n\n\nMath.floor(…) - in case we want the rounding always to be down to the previous integer. For example, if we have the number 5.99 and use  Math.floor (5.99) , we get the number 5:\n\nlet numberToFloor = 5.99;\nconsole.log(Math.floor(numberToFloor));\n// This will print on the console 5\n\n\nMath.ceil(…) - in case we want the rounding always to be up to the previous integer. For example, if we have the number 5.13 and use Math.ceil(5.13), we\nwill get the number 6:\n\nlet numberToCeil = 5.13;\nconsole.log(Math.floor(numberToCeil));\n// This will print on the console 6\n\n\nMath.trunc(…) - in case we want to remove the fractional part. For example, if we have the number 2.63 and use Math.trunc(2.63), we will get the number 2:\n\nlet numberToTrunc = 2.63;\nconsole.log(Math.floor(numberToTrunc));\n// This will print on the console 2\n\nUse === Instead of ==, and !== Insted of !=\nThe operators == and != make automatic conversion of the compared value or variable, while the operators === and !== does not make such a conversion and if both values are not of the same type - the result is false. They (== and !=) make a comparison of value and type, which is more accurate and even faster. Let's look at the following example to clarify what is meant by data type:\n[10] === 10    // false\n[10] == 10    // true\n\"10\" == 10     // true\n\"10\" === 10    // false\n [] == 0     // true\n [] === 0     // false\n \"\" == false   // true but true == \"a\" is false\n \"\" === false // false\n\nWe see how the number 10 can be written in our programs in different ways. Written in this way [10] is an array of one number. In short, arrays are multiple values stored to a variable. For example:\nlet array = [10, 20, 30, 40];\n// This is a variable of type array\n\nWe will learn more about arrays later but for now, let's just think about whether the array [10] is normally equal to the number 10. We will give you a hint - it is not normal. Therefore, if we do not want unpleasant errors (bugs) in our programs, it is best to use the operators  === and !==.\nThe situation with other comparison operators is similar and the same logic applies there.\nHow to Write a Conditional Statement?\nThe conditional if statement contains the following elements:\n\nKeyword if\nA Boolean expression (condition)\nBody of the conditional construction\nOptional: else clause\n\nif (condition) {\n    // body\n}\nelse (condition) {\n    // body\n}\n\nTo make it easier we can use a code snippet for an if construction: if + [Tab] + [Tab].\nHow to Write a 'For' Loop?\nFor a for loop we need a couple of things:\n\nInitializing block, in which the counter variable is declared (let i) and its initial value is set.\nCondition for repetition (i ).\nUpdating statement (i++).\nBody of the loop.\n\nfor (let i = 0; i \nTo be easier to write it, we can use the code snippet for the for loop: for + [Tab] + [Tab].\nUsing The So-Called Positive (Truthy) and Negative (Falsy) Value\nAll Truthy values used in the if conditional statement will give a positive result and accordingly or program will continue ist execution in the body of the conditional statement (for the example here the body of the conditional statement is not formatted correctly).\nFor some of them it seems logical to give a positive result, but for others not so much.\n//Truthy\nif (true) {}       //true\nif ({}) {}         //true\nif ([]) {}         //true\nif (42) {}         //true\nif (\"foo\") {}      //true\nif (new Date()) {} //true\nif (-42) {}        //true\nif (3.14) {}       //true\nif (-3.14) {}      //true\nif (Infinity) {}   //true\nif (-Infinity) {}  //true\n\nConversely, all Falsy values will give a negative result and the program will not enter the body of the conditional statement.\n//Falsy\nif (false) {}       //false\nif (null) {}        //false\nif (undefined) {}   //false\nif (0) {}           //false\nif (NaN) {}         //false\nif ('') {}          //false\nif (\"\") {}          //false\n\nIt is not necessary to know these values by heart at this stage, but only to remember that there are so-called Truthy and Falsy values. Over time, we will get used to how to use them properly and how they help us shorten our code. \nWhat Have We Learned from This Chapter?\nIn the current chapter, we learned how to correctly format and name the elements of our code, some shortcuts for work in Visual Studio Code, some code snippets, and how to debug code.\n"},"chapter-12-conclusion.html":{"url":"chapter-12-conclusion.html","title":"Conclusion","keywords":"","body":"Conclusion\nIf you have read the entire book and you've solved all the problems from the exercises and reached the present conclusion, congratulations! You've already made the first step in learning the profession of a programmer, but there is a long way to go until you become really good and make software writing your profession.\nRemember the four main groups of skills that each programmer must have so we can work in the industry:\n\nSkill #1 – writing the program code (20% of programmer's skills) – covered to a large degree by this book, but you must learn additional basic data structures, classes, functions, strings, and other elements of code writing.\nSkill #2 – algorithmic thinking (30% of programmer's skills) – covered partially by this book and developed mostly by solving a large amount of diverse algorithmic problems.\nSkill #3 – a fundamental understanding of the profession (25% of programmer's skills) – acquired for a few years in combination with learning and practice (reading books, watching video lessons, attending courses, and mostly by writing diverse projects in various technological areas).\nSkill #4 – programming languages and software technologies (25% of programmer's skills) – acquired in a long period, by a lot of practice, consistent reading, and writing projects. Such knowledge and skills quickly get outdated and need to be updated frequently. Good programmers are involved in studying new technologies every day.\n\nThis Book is Only The First Step!\nThe present book on programming basics is just the first step in building the skills of a programmer. If you were able to solve all problems, this means you have obtained valuable knowledge in the programming principles with JavaScript language on a basic level. You are about to start in-depth studying of programming, develop your algorithmic thinking, and then add technological knowledge regarding JavaScript language, Node.js ecosystem (Node.js, npm, Express.js, etc.), front-end technologies (HTML, CSS, Angular, React, AJAX, HTML5) and many other concepts, technologies and instruments for software development.\nIf you were not able to solve all problems or a large part of them, go back and solve them! Remember that becoming a programmer requires a lot of work and effort. This profession is not for lazy people. There is no way to learn it unless you seriously practice programming for years!\nAs we already explained, the first and basic skill of a programmer is to learn to write code with ease and pleasure. This is namely the mission of this book: to teach you how to code.\nWhat to Do After Reading This Book?\nThis book gives you solid foundations, thanks to which it will be easy for you to continue developing as a programmer. If you wonder how to continue your development, you have the following possibilities:\n\nto study for a software developer at SoftUni and make programming your profession.\nto continue developing as a programmer on your own, for example through self-training or via free online lessons.\nto stay at a coder level, without going more seriously into programming.\n\nStudy Software Engineering at SoftUni\nThe first option, which we recommend, is to enroll in a Software Developer program to master programming on a professional level. The SoftUni curriculum is carefully developed by Dr. Svetlin Nakov and his team, to provide you consequently and with gradually increasing complexity all the skills that a software engineer must have, to start a career as a software developer in an IT company. \nSoftUni’s self-paced programs are designed as a sequence of modules giving you fundamental knowledge in software development and practical skills to prepare you to work as a programmer with the latest software technologies. The classes are divided into learning theory (30%) and doing exercises and projects (70%).\nIt Takes at Least a Year of Intense Code Writing to Become a Programmer\nKeep in mind that to become a programmer takes a lot of effort, writing tens of thousands of lines of code, and solving hundreds, even thousands of practical problems, and this takes years! If someone offers you \"an easier program\" and promises you to become a programmer and start working within 3-4 months, then either they are lying to you, or they will give you such a low level, that companies won't even take you as a trainee, even if you pay to the company that is wasting its time with you. There are exceptions, of course, for example, if you are not starting from scratch, or if you have extremely well-developed engineering thinking, or if you apply for a very low position (for example technical support), but in general, you cannot become a programmer if you haven't spent at least 1 year of intense learning and code writing!\n\n\nHow Many Hours Per Day Does The Training Take?\nThe training for software engineers at SoftUni is a very serious occupation and you need to spend at least 4-5 hours every day, preferably your entire attention and time. Combining training with other obligations is not always easy. Of course, it is always best if you can dedicate all your time and attention to mastering programming but SoftUni’s self-paced Software Developer programs make it possible to learn at your own pace. They are great for high school pupils, university students, and people with full or part-time jobs. And remember, you cannot become a successful software developer by only practicing 2-4 hours a week. As a minimum, you need to spend at least 20-30 hours a week learning to code.\nSoftUni for People Who Work and Study\nWe recommend to everyone who gets an excellent score at Judge Problems and is passionate about making programming their profession, to consider leaving the rest of their commitments aside to spend more time on learning the profession of a software engineer and start making a living through it.\nWe recommend to all who cannot get an excellent score at the Judge problems to spend more time on better learning, understanding, and most of all, practicing the material studied in the present book. If you cannot easily solve the problems in this book, you will not be able to cope with programming and software development in the future.\nStudy Software Engineering on Your Own\nAnother possibility to develop after this book is to continue studying programming outside of SoftUni. You can enroll or subscribe to video training, that goes into more details in programming with Python or other languages and development platforms. You can read books on programming and software technologies, follow online tutorials and other online resources – there are plenty of free materials on the Internet. However, keep in mind that the most important thing about the profession of a programmer is to do practical projects!\nYou cannot become a programmer without a lot of code writing and intense practice. Allocate sufficient time to it. You cannot become a programmer for a month or two. On the Internet, you will find a wide variety of free resources such as books, manuals, and video lessons. However, you need to invest at least a year or two, to acquire a foundation level, needed for starting a job.\nAfter you gain some experience, find a way to start an internship in a company (which will be almost impossible unless you'd spent at least a year of intense code writing before that) or come up with your practical project, on which you need to spend a few months, even a year, to learn based on the trial-and-error principle.\n\nKeep in mind that there are many ways to become a programmer, but they all have something in common: code writing and years of practice!\n\n\n\nOnline Communities for Beginners in Programming\nRegardless of the path you have chosen, if you are seriously involved in programming, we recommend subscribing to specialized online forums, discussion groups, and communities, from which you can get assistance from your colleagues and track the novelties in the software industry.\nIf you aim to study programming seriously, surround yourselves with people who are involved in programming seriously. Join communities of software developers, attend software conferences, go to events for programmers, find friends with whom you can talk about programming and discuss problems and bugs, find an environment that can help you. In most large towns there are free events for programmers, a few times a week. In smaller localities, you have the Internet and access to the entire online community.\nHere are some recommended resources, that will be useful for your development as a programmer:\n\nhttps://learn.softuni.org –  the official page for SoftUni’s self-paced Software Developer programs and open courses.\nhttps://www.facebook.com/softuni.org – official Facebook page of SoftUni. By it, you will learn about new courses, seminars, and events related to programming and software development.\nhttps://introprogramming.info - official website of the books \"Programming Basics\" with C#, Java, JavaScript, and Python by Dr. Svetlin Nakov and his team. The books examine in-depth programming basics, basic data structures and algorithms, object-oriented programming, and other basic skills, and are an excellent continuation for reading after the current book. However, besides reading, you need to do intense code writing, do not forget that!\nhttps://stackoverflow.com - Stack Overflow is one of the widest discussion forums for programmers worldwide, where you will find assistance for any possible question in the world of programming. If you are fluent in English, look up at StackOverflow and ask your questions there.\nhttps://www.meetup.com - search tech meetups around your town and enter the community that you like. More of the tech meetups are free and the newcomers are welcome.\n\nGood Luck to All of You!\nOn behalf of the entire authors' team, we wish you endless success in the profession and your life! We will be really happy if we have helped you get passionate about programming and we have inspired you to go bravely towards becoming a \"software engineer\", which will bring you a good job that you will work with pleasure, give you a high-quality life, and prosperity, as well as amazing perspectives for development and possibilities for making impressive projects with inspiration and passion.\nSofia, May 30, 2019\n"}}}
